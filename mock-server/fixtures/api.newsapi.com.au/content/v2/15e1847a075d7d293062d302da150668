The Dark Tower is essentially King’s magnum opus, and every piece of fiction King has written connects to this one story. Get ready to get out your cork boards and string.\n\nWHY IT’S NOT THAT CRAZY \n\nThe Dark Tower’s connections to the rest of the King-verse are mostly distant, but if you’re up on your horror knowledge, you should be able to keep track of them. For example, The Dark Tower‘s protagonist Roland encounters several villains on his quest to destroy the Crimson King. However, one of the most notable of those villains is Randall Flagg, who is also the antagonist of The Stand. \n\nThere are tons of other connections. Later in the series The Dark Tower introduces the foe Dandelo, who turns into a clown. Most assume that Dandelo is actually Pennywise the clown from IT. Because Pennywise is real in The Dark Tower universe, that also means Derry is real, which opens up a world of connections. Dick Hallorann, the man who understood Danny’s powers in The Shining, is actually the father of one of the kids from IT. Not only that but Paul Sheldon, the author that Kathy Bates tortures in Misery, is also from Derry. Derry is also the site of the alien invasion that takes place in Dreamcatcher as well as a setting in 11/22/63. That’s just a sampling of all the mind-blowing connections. Also, it really sucks to live in Derry.\n\nWHY IT’S QUESTIONABLE \n\nAs far as insane, interconnected theories go, this is one holds up the most. It’s as close to officially endorsed as possible. Now when you’re overwhelmed by the thousands of hours and millions of pages of Stephen King movies and books, just remember they’re all part of a larger puzzle you’ll never understand.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Decider and is republished here with permission. \n\n","standFirst":"MISERY, The Stand, IT, The Dark Tower — Stephen King is a master of suspense, and this fan theory makes a believable case that all his stories are connected too.\n\n","kicker":"Fan theory","byline":"Cayla Cobb","commentsAllowed":false,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":false,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Cayla Cobb"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]}
