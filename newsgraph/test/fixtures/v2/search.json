Just days before it is partially eclipsed, the Sun is in Cancer, completing the final, in a series, of Water Grand Trines involving Jupiter (in watery Scorpio) and Neptune (also in a water sign, Pisces). Meanwhile, Venus, Saturn and Uranus are uniting in their own Grand Trine of Earth signs. But these formations aren't in competition. And towards the end of the month a total lunar eclipse, conjunct Mars, suggests we may have to change our perception of winning. There can be victory through harmony.\n\n",

When you can't find your way, you can ask for directions, look for road signs or open up Google Maps. In other areas of life, though, the answer isn't always as easy to find. As your ruler Jupiter turns direct this month remember that second-guessing will get you nowhere fast. As Venus moves opposite your sign, just take one step forward. Then another. You'll be amazed where you end up.\n\n",
