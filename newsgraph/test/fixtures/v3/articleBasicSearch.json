We have managed crises but we have lost our way,” he said, adding that France would help drive a revival of the European idea of “social justice”. </p><p>\n               <a capiid=\"d3b3674ac8acf0515a777f8963c7a84b\" class=\"capi-video\">Macron wins parliamentary majority</a>\n            </p><p/><p/>"

The Democrats were deregistered as a political party in 2008.</p><p id=\"U624170480212u6H\" style=\"font-stretch:100%;\">Some pragmatic negotiations over the GST – which achieved exemptions for fresh food, health and education – could be seen as honouring the party’s then recent election commitment to work with the government of the ­<br/>day, yet it became a catalyst for internecine warfare.</p><p>This is a history lesson that the Australian Greens should heed closely as the recriminations and sniping over NSW Senator Lee Rhiannon continue in the wake of her expulsion from party room meetings. That quite extraordinary measure was taken after Senator Rhiannon broke ranks with other Greens MPs to publicly oppose a compromise deal allowing the Government’s “Gonski 2.0” school funding package to pass the Senate.</p><p>Since then, the battle lines have been drawn, with Senator Rhiannon describing herself as “roadkill” in a wider agenda aimed at undermining <br/>the democratic power of the NSW wing of the party.</p><p>This sectarian squabble is  just the sort of arcane politics that turn voters off in droves, regardless of their feelings about core Green policy platforms such as climate change, marriage equality or refugee rights.</p><p>In short, it is driven by narrow ideological purity, the sort of holier-than-thou politics which saw the Greens block the passage of then prime minister Kevin Rudd’s Emissions Trading Scheme in 2009. Ultimately, that short-term self-interest saw the ETS replaced by a carbon price that Tony Abbott swiftly repealed when in government. The end result, in other words, was the Greens’ bloody-mindedness ultimately working absolutely contrary to their stated aims.</p><p>If the Greens harbour any desire to remain relevant, and to make a contribution to the national interest, it is about time they learned that successful politics is all about the art of compromise. That means  using the numbers you have to negotiate the best possible outcome  with the government of the day, an area in which South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon has displayed considerable dexterity to date.</p><p>If the Greens wish their future to be the political fringes, then so be it; continue brawling inside a bubble at a time when a government riven by its own ugly internal tensions is desperate to get  some policy runs on the board and is prepared to deal accordingly.</p><p>Sanctimonious idealism may appeal to hard-core sections of the Greens base, but combined with factional infighting and discord it will repel voters. Accepting that sometimes half a win is better than a loss might also be a good start for the party.</p><p> </p><p><b>WHATEVER THE ELECTION DATE, TOURISM FIGHT MUST COME FIRST</b></p><p><b/></p><p>IT seems veteran boxing promoter Bob Arum knows something Queenslanders don’t: the date for the next state election. When talking about a rematch between new world champion Jeff Horn and his vanquished foe, legendary fighter Manny Pacquiao, the Las Vegas-based promoter indicated he’d been told a November election was likely. Red-faced Kate Jones, the state’s Major Events Minister, tried to laugh off Mr Arum’s insight by quickly adding “January we’re due”.</p><p>Still, it appeared the jig is up and an election in November is being pondered by the upper echelons of the Palaszczuk Government. Regardless of which side wins the next election, however, both should vow to fight to bring the rematch back. While boxing has its critics, there is no doubt that Sunday’s showdown at Suncorp Stadium was a boon for Brisbane. Almost 20,000 of the 51,000 fans that watched the fight were from interstate or overseas. </p><p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who  appeared at a press conference alongside Horn yesterday, was right when she pointed out that these kinds of events return  big on their investment. When it comes to event tourism, Queensland has  long been on the undercard while Victoria and NSW have fought in the main event. </p><p>However Sunday’s “Battle of Brisbane”, as well as the Gold Coast’s highly-successful marathon, showed appropriate government investment can generate a windfall for local economies.</p><p>Mr Arum’s insight of a November election, no doubt gleaned from his negotiations over a rematch, may yet prove folly.</p><p> After all, politics can be as fickle as the fight game.</p><p>However, a well-funded event tourism plan is a policy both sides should have whenever the Battle for Queensland begins.</p><p> </p><p><i>Responsibility for election comment is taken by Lachlan Heywood, corner of Mayne Rd &amp; Campbell St, Bowen Hills, Qld 4006.

The ATO’s ruling could mean massive refunds and ongoing reductions for hundreds of thousands of passive family investment companies. For example, one warehousing $1m of taxable income per year could save $25,000 for each tax year.</p><p>\n               <a class=\"capi-image\" capiId=\"bd31650f15cb585c4dad026126ea8a6d\"></a>\n            </p><p>BDO senior tax partner Tony Sloan told <i>The Australian </i>that the change is “massive.” “Everyone is talking about it. It affects a lot of our clients,” he said.</p><p>There could, however, be issues if family companies don’t plan their affairs properly. Mr Sloan said<i/>that mum-and-dad shareholders of low-tax companies could be hit if the companies chose to distribute fully franked dividends to them.</p><p>However, he said many of those types of companies and their shareholders would benefit from the new ruling, particularly wealthy families, as their companies tended to warehouse profits “over years and decades”, and were frequently used as a form of “family bank”.</p><p>When the tax cuts were announced a few years ago, it was made clear they would only apply to companies that carried on a business. However, the ATO has taken a much more generous stance than expected for passive family companies. Its draft ruling states that “generally, where a company is established or maintained to make profit or gain for its shareholders it is likely to carry on business ... This is so even if the company only holds passive investments, and its activities consist of receiving rents or returns on its investments and distributing them to shareholders.”</p><p>\n               <a class=\"capi-image\" capiId=\"63d295d49d19d122462a413ab6558141\"></a>\n            </p><p>Sources told <i>The Australian</i> that the ATO had indicated it was working on more detailed guidance on the issue, which would be published “very soon”. “The ATO is aware there is a lot of interest in this topic,” the source said.</p><p>Mr Sloan said most family investment companies would already have filed a return for the 2016 year at the full 30 per cent company tax rate. He is advising these entities to consider seeking a refund for the 2016 financial year and to review the position for the 2017 financial year. “Even for my own family company, which has a range of passive investments, I filed my return in 2016 at the 30 per cent company tax rate,” Mr Sloan said. “Once the ATO issues its final guidance on this matter that clarifies that passive companies are indeed carrying on a business, I will be looking for a refund as well. I went to a meeting the other day with 10 people in the room, where this issue was discussed. Every person in the room had a family investment company.”</p><p>The tax cuts affected companies that earned up to $10m in income in 2016-17, rising to $25m this financial year.</p><p/><p>\n               <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/treasury/ato-signals-tax-windfall-for-wealthy/news-story/8f5ee654e2c2bcdd9266ef2d611419f4\">This story was originally published in The Australian and is reprinted with permission.</a>\n            </p>"
