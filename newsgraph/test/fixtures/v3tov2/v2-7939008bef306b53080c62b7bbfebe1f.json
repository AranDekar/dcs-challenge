            "body": "Scott Morrison’s self-described “miracle” should also bring stability to the superannuation system, insiders believe.\n\nThat said, there are predictions the Prime Minister may look to act on negative gearing concessions and franking credit refunds — albeit it in a far more limited, and palatable, way than Labor planned.\n\nSuch changes could find support on the new-look Senate crossbench, where there is concern about whether the extra $158 billion of personal income tax cuts proposed in the Budget can be delivered without a reduction in government services.\n\nFrom a hip-pocket perspective, that’s the Reader’s Digest version of what you need to know about how things could play out from here. \n\nNow for the detail …\n\nEFFECT ON THE PROPERTY MARKET \n\n“The big negative around Labor winning and changing the tax arrangements for property has now gone,” said AMP Capital’s highly respected head of investment strategy Shane Oliver.\n\nThe likely impact of Labor’s negative gearing and capital gains reforms would have been to deepen the drop by 8 per cent to nearly 30 per cent in Sydney and 20 per cent in Melbourne, Dr Oliver, who is also AMP’s chief economist, said. \n\nNow Sydney’s decline looked like being limited to about 20 per cent, while Melbourne could bottom out 15 per cent below the 2017 peak. \n\nSydney has already fallen 15 per cent and Melbourne by 11 per cent. \n\nHe expected the low points to now come sooner.\n\nAussie Home Loans founder John Symond said people were “rightly” concerned the value of their own home would fall further under Labor’s changes. \n\n“It really scared the hell out of the community,” Mr Symond said.\n\nWhat the Coalition victory means for you \n\nWhy Queensland turned its back on Labor \n\n“It was a huge positive for Australia that the Coalition got up,” he said. “Confidence is everything and it’s been lacking badly.”\n\nAuction clearance rates were what to watch for signs of improving confidence, he said.\n\nHe didn’t expect markets would go “gangbusters” again and that was a good thing.\n\nMr Symond said reforming negative gearing “should be done” — just not how Labor planned.\n\nHe favours a cap on what can be claimed, rather than axing the concession.\n\n“It shouldn’t be there for wealthy people, me included, to really try to milk the cow dry.”\n\nMr Symond said he attempted to discuss negative gearing with Chris Bowen six weeks ago but the shadow treasurer “wasn’t interested”.\n\nMr Symond said he had spoken with others who had met with Labor and they reported an “arrogance”.\n\n“They acted like they were already in government”.\n\nBudget Calculator 2019 \n\nSUPERANNUATION AND FRANKING CREDITS \n\nOne of the nation’s leading experts on super, Rice Warner founder Michael Rice, said a “period of stability” was now likely but that didn’t mean there would be a “vacuum where we can all relax”.\n\nMr Rice said “you could still modify the system” to target the people Labor meant to “but did a very bad job of”. For example, there was a strong case for restricting franking credit refunds for self-managed super funds containing more than $5 million.\n\n“If you want to do things that are unpopular they usually say it’s best to do it in the first year of your term,” Mr Rice said.\n\nThe significant change coming to super would be the forced closure of up to 28 underperforming funds, Mr Rice said. Members of those funds would be put into better products, he said.\n\nNED-0429-Liberal-and-Labor-Budget-Promises \n\nTAX CHANGES UNDER SCOTT MORRISON \n\nIn April’s budget, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveiled a plan to deepen already legislated tax cuts set for 2022-23 and 2024-25. \n\nLabor opposed the new relief and vowed to repeal the cuts that passed the Upper House last year.\n\nThose cuts went through with the support of crossbench senators including several who weren’t re-elected on Saturday — Derryn Hinch and Fraser Anning among them.\n\nThe bill to deepen the cuts will likely require the backing of South Australia’s Centre Alliance, which was the Nick Xenophon team until he left to unsuccessfully pursue a spot in SA’s parliament.\n\nStirling Griff — one of Centre Alliance’s two senators — said it wanted a Treasury briefing on whether forgoing the tax revenue would reduce government services. \n\n“We are not there to be wreckers and we are not putting up a roadblock,” Senator Griff said.\n\n“Provided we get an update from Treasury and work through the numbers there’s a good chance we will not have any issues with it.”\n\nSenator Griff also said that while Centre Alliance “certainly didn’t support” Labor’s franking credits plan, it was open to looking at changes aimed at those “abusing” the system. \n\nAnd the party was willing to discuss reforms that limited the number of properties a person could negatively gear.\n\nNED-0633-Tax-Saved-Under-Coalition \n\n“There are some people that are fleecing the system that are doing so via franking credits or via negative gearing … and even tax havens,” Senator Griff said. “The focus should be on those abusing the system.”\n\nTasmania’s Jacqui Lambie — back after resigning in the citizenship saga — did not respond, nor did One Nation.\n\nA spokesman for the Prime Minister said “there will be no changes” to negative gearing or franking credits.\n\nConnect with John Rolfe on Facebook or Twitter \n\n",

A tax refund of up to $1080 per person will come in your ATO return.\n\n· Smaller refunds will be paid below and above this range, up to $126,000.\n\n· The chances of tax cuts from 2022-23 just shot up, although there will be another election first.\n\n· Higher-income earners will avoid the raids that would have come under Bill Shorten.\n\nEMPTY NESTERS \n\n· A Morrison government is better than PM Shorten for this group.\n\n· The ALP would have denied franking credit cash refunds on Aussie share dividends.\n\n· It also planned to make it harder to build a nest by making catch-up contributions.\n\n· The Coalition will scrap the work test for voluntary super contributions those aged 65 or 66.\n\nMORE: How Queensland helped deliver a Coalition win \n\nMORE: How Labor lost the election \n\nSMALL BUSINESS OWNERS \n\n· Instant asset write-off threshold will rise from $25,000 to $30,000 per asset.\n\n· Access to the scheme has been expanded to medium-sized businesses.\n\n· Funding for up to 80,000 new apprenticeships over five years.\n\n· The existing incentive for taking on apprentices will be doubled to $8000.\n\nSTUDENTS \n\n· Not the Coalition’s strong suit. There was a better deal on offer from Labor.\n\n· But there will be $94 million of scholarships to study at regional universities.\n\n· $525 million vocational skills package announced in the Budget.\n\n· Those planning to become commercial pilots get more VET loan assistance.\n\nRETIREES \n\n· If you’re self-funded, crack a bottle of bubbly – this is a great result for you.\n\n· Labor’s plan to abolish franking credit cash refunds would have been a hammer blow.\n\n· That would have netted $58 billion to 2030 – from the savings of people like you.\n\n· There is not much on offer for age pensioners; Labor had promised dental help.\n\n",

            "body": "Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton - who was tipped to potentially be one of the biggest Coalition scalps of the election - praised Mr Morrison’s “amazing leadership” as he claimed victory in his marginal seat of Dickson last night. \n\nThe Sunshine state swung behind the Coalition last night, with no LNP members losing their seats. \n\nBut Labor suffered swings of more than 10 per cent against them in some seats.\n\nA number of “safe” ALP seats in Queensland have now turned marginal, including former Treasurer Wayne Swan’s seat of Lilley and Graham Perrett’s seat of Moreton. \n\nThe LNP picked up at least two seats from Labor in Queensland, Longman and Herbert.\n\nIt looks set to hold its marginal seats of Brisbane, Flynn, Bonner, Petrie, Forde, Dawson, and Capricornia.\n\nCapricornia Liberal MP Michelle Landry said the massive swing towards her was “beyond belief”.\n\nBrisbane inset Federal Election map \n\nShe said she owed her success to a convoy of anti-Adani protesters, which descended on central Queensland last month.\n\n“Thank you Bob Brown is all I can say,” she said.\n\nAnd Labor frontbencher Shayne Neumann could potentially lose his seat of Blair, despite going in to the election with an 8.1 per cent margin. \n\nHerbert, the most marginal seat in the country, was one of a number of Labor seats to fall to the Coalition across the country. \n\nOne Nation preference flows helped the LNP’s Phillip Thompson snatch the Townsville-centric seat from Labor’s Cathy O’Toole, with Pauline Hanson’s party claiming about 11 per cent of the primary vote by 9.30pm. \n\nClaiming victory before 10pm last night, Mr Dutton attributed the LNP’s strong vote in Queensland to Mr Morrison’s “amazing leadership”. \n\n“He’s distilled our message down to one which the Australian people understand,” Mr Dutton said. \n\n“He’s been able to campaign in marginal seats, he’s been able to put pressure on Bill Shorten, which is what Bill Shorten deserved. \n\n“And to Scott Morrison’s great credit right across this great country, he’s been able to spread a message of our vision for the future of this country, and people have overwhelmingly accepted that.”\n\nConcern about jobs, Labor’s plan to axe tax refunds for franking credits and the ALP’s uncertain position on the Adani coalmine impacted the party’s vote in Queensland.\n\nPenny Wong said the state had been tough for Labor.\n\n“It’s been tough in Queensland for a fair while for Labor federally,” she said.\n\n“We’ve had state Labor governments but that hasn’t, other than in ‘07, translated into a strong federal vote.”\n\nLiberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos said the coalition’s jobs message cut through in Queensland.\n\n“I think the story’s in two parts. I think north Queensland and central Queensland … Adani became about jobs,” he said.\n\n“The Bob Brown caravan which went up there to talk about stopping Adani, had the effect of making a lot of locals say ‘hang on, you are not going to tell us how to live’.\n\nLabor’s primary vote plunged 4.29 per cent in Queensland - one of its worst results across the country. \n\nOn two-party terms, the LNP’s vote jumped 3.64 per cent in Queensland.\n\nConcern about jobs, Labor’s plan to axe tax refunds for franking credits and the ALP’s uncertain position on the Adani coalmine all contributed to the party’s vote crashing in the state. \n\nThe key marginal seats in play were Petrie, Bonner, Capricornia, Dawson, Flynn, Forde, Herbert and Dickson. \n\nThe LNP’s primary vote remained steady or jumped in each of the seats, while One Nation was a clear kingmaker in a number of the electorates.\n\n",
            "standFirst": "Queensland has essentially gifted Scott Morrison the election, overwhelmingly rejecting a Bill Shorten-led government. Here’s what caused voters to turn their backs on Labor. \n\n",

He also likes a hit of tennis and enjoys DJing. \n\nRoles in parliament: Shadow Minister for Ageing and Seniors, Shadow Minister for Employment Services and Training, Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Shadow Minister for Environment and Heritage, Shadow Minister for Water, Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Shadow Minister for Water and Infrastructure, Leader of the House, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Shadow Minister for Tourism, Shadow Minister for Cities, Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development\n\nKnown for: Monash University politics expert Dr Nick Economou said Mr Albanese’s greatest moment was winning the membership ballot against Bill Shorten when they both contested the leadership position following Labor’s loss at the 2013 federal election.\n\nThis meant Mr Albanese had the backing of the ALP’s members, but ultimately lost out at the caucus vote, which backed Mr Shorten.\n\n“It’s had Albanese sitting there as the leader in waiting, looming in the background while Mr Shorten was leader all this time,” Dr Economou said. \n\n“He also appeared to really enjoy his time as Infrastructure Minister while Labor was in government.”\n\nAge: 46\n\nStar sign: Capricorn\n\nElectorate: Division of McMahon, NSW, elected in 2004\n\nFaction: Labor Right, joined the party when he was 15\n\nWhere he grew up: Smithfield, NSW\n\nMarital status: Married to Rebecca Mifsud\n\nChildren: Grace, 14 and Max, 11\n\nSalary: $248,800 a year\n\nFirst job: Unknown - but prior to entering parliament he served as a councillor on Fairfield Council and at one point served as mayor\n\nQualifications: Bachelor of Economics (University of Sydney), Masters Degree in International Relations and a Diploma of Modern Languages (Bahasa Indonesia)\n\nHobbies: He enjoys keeping fit, reading and watching AFL. \n\nRoles in parliament: Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Minister for Human Services, Cabinet Minister, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Minister for Small Business, Shadow Treasurer\n\nKnown for: Monash University politics expert Dr Nick Economou said unfortunately for Chris Bowen, his defining moment in parliament was his contribution to Labor’s failure at this year’s federal election.\n\n“His greatest moment in federal politics is one he’d rather forget - being the Shadow Treasurer in a Labor opposition that managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,” Dr Economou said. \n\n“And he as Shadow Treasurer made a major contribution to Labor’s amazing failure.”\n\nIgnoring other potential leadership contenders, Dr Economou said the party would be on the right track selecting either Mr Bowen or Mr Albanese.\n\nHe said a NSW-based Labor leader would look better in the eyes of Queenslanders, who turned on the party at the ballot box and were a major factor in its spectacular loss.\n\n“No Melburnian should be involved in the reconstruction if Queenslanders are involved,” Dr Economou said.\n\n“If you have Melbourne factored into it, you are going to have bubble politics - a very small group of people from inner-Melbourne who talk to each other and construct an orthodoxy that they think can’t be challenged. And clearly they are out of touch with the vast majority of Australians.”\n\n“Sydney and NSW have always had a closer affinity with Queensland and Brisbane.”\n\nBut ultimately, he believed Mr Albanese would but Labor at a competitive advantage in the lead-up to, and at the 2022 federal election.”\n\n“I think Albanese has managed to avoid most of the opprobrium associated with the failed campaign,” Dr Economou said, adding that the leadership hopeful came across like an “everyday bloke” who could take on Scott Morrison’s appealing “daggy dad image”.\n\n“[Albanese] is the last of the Labor men who strike me as being manful... clearly Labor’s obsession with feminism has not been rewarded at the ballot box,” he said.\n\nHe added identity politics should be left to the Greens, and Labor needed to get back to talking about things that matter.\n\n“Unfortunately for Chris Bowen, his reputation has been tarnished by Labor’s unpopular federal election policies, such as its proposed changes to franking credits and negative gearing,” he said.\n\n“Not only will that remain in the minds of the public, but more importantly, it’ll be in the minds of their political opponents, and the Coalition would be delighted with Chris Bowen as Labor leader because he would be an easy target.”\n\n",
            "standFirst": "High-profile Labor MPs Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen are going head-to-head for the Labor leadership. This is what you don’t know about them and who can heal the party.\n\n",

    "body": "Hot on the heels of their shock election loss, the ALP is on the cusp of descending into the kind of infighting the party hasn’t seen since the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era. \n\nAnthony Albanese and Mr Bowen both put their hand up for Shorten’s job this week, before Mr Bowen withdrew this afternoon. \n\nUp and coming Labor frontbencher Jim Chalmers could still throw his hat into the ring. \n\nThe Queenslander will announce his decision tomorrow. \n\nIf Mr Chalmers runs, Labor will go through an internal process to determine the next leader which could last a month as party members and Labor MPs get to vote in two separate ballots.\n\nMORE POLITICS NEWS: \n\nHow ScoMo’s ‘miracle’ win will hit your wallet \n\nWhat the Coalition victory means for you \n\nHow Queensland helped deliver a Coalition win \n\nAlbanese vs Bowen: What you don’t know \n\n‘Albo’ is aligned to Labor’s Left faction, while Mr Bowen and Mr Chalmers belong to Labor’s Right.\n\nThe Right was openly divided today over whether to back Mr Bowen, given he was the architect of Labor’s policy to axe tax refunds for franking credits.\n\nThe policy, which cost Labor support in key marginal electorates, is considered one of the main reasons for its stunning election loss.\n\nThe Left faction has swung behind ‘Albo’ after Tanya Plibersek - the other key Left candidate - bowed out of the race. \n\nTEAM ALBO V TEAM BOWEN \n\nSupport for Mr Albanese and Mr Bowen mostly split on factional lines - but not entirely. \n\nLabor giant Penny Wong backed Mr Albanese, which is unsurprising given they are both members of the party’s Left faction. \n\nBut Tony Burke and Kristina Keneally, senior figures of the NSW Right, have also indicated support for Mr Albanese.\n\nBill Shorten’s Victorian Right faction was understood to be backing Mr Bowen before he withdrew.\n\nWHO IS ON LABOR’S RIGHT AND LEFT? \n\nMost Labor MPs are members of either the Right or the Left faction of the wider Australian Labor Party, with only a few unaligned. \n\nThe Right, the more socially conservative faction, is currently dominant.\n\nMost former party leaders, including Bill Shorten, have come from this faction. \n\nJulia Gillard was an exception but she had the backing of the Right faction. \n\nThere are also sub-factions of the Left and Right in each state and territory, which won’t necessarily back the same person for the leadership. \n\nHere’s how the current Shadow cabinet members are aligned: \n\nTHE LEFT FACTION \n\nNED-0646-shadow-ministers-left \n\nTHE RIGHT FACTION \n\nNED-0646-shadow-ministers-right \n\nWHY WON’T TANYA PLIBERSEK RUN? \n\nAs deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek would have been a natural successor to Bill Shorten. \n\nBut she confirmed on Monday she wouldn’t be running against Anthony Albanese. \n\nBoth are members of the Left faction, so it would have split the vote between them if they each ran for the leadership. \n\nShe was also part of the central leadership team which led Labor to a loss, while Mr Albanese was more on the fringe as Shadow Infrastructure Minister. \n\nMs Plibersek cited family reasons for her decision not to run. \n\nIn a statement on Monday she noted she had support from across the party to be elected leader but said “now is not my time”. \n\n“At this point, I cannot reconcile the important responsibilities I have to my family with the additional responsibilities of the Labor leadership,” Ms Plibersek said. \n\n“I know some people will be disappointed with this decision. \n\n“I intend to continue as deputy leader until the leadership is determined. \n\n“At that point I will I serve in whatever capacity my colleagues best think can help Labor return to government.” \n\nPENNY WONG’S WARNING FOR BILL SHORTEN \n\nPenny Wong sent a thinly veiled caution to the outgoing Labor leader today not to get involved in the process to elect his successor. \n\nIt comes after reports Mr Shorten has been “actively lobbying” colleagues to ensure someone runs against Mr Albanese.\n\nTheir rivalry comes from the last leadership contest in 2013 after Labor lost government.\n\nMr Shorten and Mr Albanese both ran for the top job.\n\nMr Albanese won the popular vote of ALP party base but Mr Shorten won more support from the Labor caucus. \n\nThe two ballots are weighted equally when Labor elects a new leader but the caucus vote got Mr Shorten across the line. \n\nAsked if Mr Shorten was lobbying for someone to run against Mr Albanese, Senator Wong said: “I would be surprised if that were occurring.” \n\n“I’d be surprised because it’s not consistent with the role he now has and I’d be surprised because it would potentially undermine the very unity he has been part of developing and building in Opposition,” she said. \n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT? \n\nIf more than one candidate emerges for the leadership, nominations for a leadership ballot must be held first and then Labor’s party base will get to vote.\n\nThat took two weeks in the 2013 contest. \n\nLabor MPs will then get their vote. \n\nThe two ballots will be evenly weighted to determine the next leader. \n\n",
