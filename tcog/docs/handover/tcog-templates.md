## templates

Review the [tcog-template-specification](http://stash.news.com.au/projects/TCOG/repos/tcog-template-specification) project for more detail on how templates are create, tested and deployed.

A [video](./video/template-deployment.mp4) is also available for more detail.

### examples

Examples can be found in the main tcog [project](http://stash.news.com.au/projects/TCOG). Templates are generally prefixed with `tcog-template`.

The most recent ones I have written are

- [Amazon Alexa](http://stash.news.com.au/projects/TCOG/repos/tcog-template-alexa)
- [query](http://stash.news.com.au/projects/TCOG/repos/tcog-template-query/browse)

Templates with build and deployment plans can be found [here](http://bamboo.news.com.au/browse/TT)

#### product templates

The bulk of product templates can be found in the [tangram project](http://stash.news.com.au/projects/TG).
