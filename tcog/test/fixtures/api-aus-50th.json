"body": "File:ABC Dollar Float.ogv\n\n1983 ABC news report on the first day of trading with a floating Australian dollar\n\nKeating was one of the major driving forces behind the various extensive macro and microeconomic reforms of the Hawke government.[9] As Treasurer, Keating pursued economic policies such as floating the Australian dollar in 1983, reducing tariffs on imports, completely reforming the tax system, moving from centralised wage-fixing to enterprise bargaining, privatising publicly owned companies such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, and deregulating large parts of the banking system. Keating was also instrumental in the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Accord, an agreement between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the government to negotiate wages. His management of the Accord, and close working relationship with ACTU President Bill Kelty, became a source of tremendous political power for Keating. Through the power given to him, Keating was often able to bypass the Cabinet altogether, notably in exercising monetary policy, and he was regularly referred to as “the most powerful Treasurer in modern times”.\n\n",

"description": "Following Labors victory in the 1983 election, Keating was appointed Treasurer of Australia by Prime Minister Bob Hawke  he would go on to hold that post until 1991. Keating succeeded John Howard as treasurer and was able to use the size of the budget deficit that the Hawke government inherited to question the economic credibility of the LiberalNational Coalition. That the deficit had significantly increased in the lead up to the election had not been disclosed in pre-election documents released by the Fraser government.[6] According to Hawke, the historically large $9.6 billion budget deficit left by the Coalition became a stick with which we were justifiably able to beat the Liberal National Opposition for many years.[6] Although Howard was widely regarded at this time as being discredited by the hidden deficit, he had in fact argued unsuccessfully against Fraser that the revised figures should be disclosed before the election.[7][8]",

He was successful in reducing union influence in the party, though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive.[45] The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem; its executive was far to the left of the rest of the ALP, and had little electoral success. Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders, and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the 1972 election\n\n",

"description": "Gough Whitlam saw that the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the traditional working-class base to include the suburban middle class.[41] He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given a voice in the conference.[42] In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist.[43] Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 3832 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.[44]",
