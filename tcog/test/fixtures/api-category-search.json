He wants to be with his staff. I think if he wants to do that, he should go all the way to Brisbane,” Mr Bleier said.\n\nThe historically listed two-storey art deco Town Hall building was built in 1935 and last used as the Gold Coast City Council’s headquarters in 1976 before the city’s elected representatives moved to Evandale.\n\nThe Bulletin understands Councillor Tate, in the email on Tuesday, foreshadowed the move by only himself and Mr Moran, explaining personal staff would remain at Evandale.\n\nSenior city councillor Dawn Crichlow, based on the ground floor of the Southport building, yesterday confirmed Cr Tate and Mr Moran would be moving in upstairs.\n\n“He sent an email to the councillors and directors yesterday about moving into Southport, into the old council chambers. There are offices upstairs,” she said.\n\n“The town planning and economic development officers go over there and have visits to do business. The Mayor will take two rooms there.”\n\nCr Crichlow suggested the move was sparked by the opening of light rail, the $6 billion Broadwater Cruise Ship project being planned on Southport’s doorstep and the business partnerships created by the $2.5 million Chinatown development.\n\n“I think it’s a pretty good move. He’s fairly smart, isn’t he,” Cr Crichlow said.\n\nBut other councillors aren’t convinced and stunned why the Mayor would remove himself from the main administration at Bundall.\n\n“It’s a bizarre move. It is taking the Mayor away from the councillors’ home. It means the rest of his office will be left at Evandale,” a councillor said.\n\n“It’s puzzling and could be overly expensive. There was no consultation. It has left all the councillors stunned.”\n\nAnother councillor told the Bulletin: “He says it will come at no cost but we’re worried there will be hidden costs like the travel from Evandale for the councillors, and then there are the furnishings.”\n\nOther council insiders suggest the move is an attempt by Cr Tate to appease the Southport business community and will win him further support from Cr Crichlow who is a key player with the vote on the cruise ship terminal split between warring councillors.\n\nThe office move will help Southport in its bid to be recognised as the city’s CBD and reduce the claim of Robina.\n\nBoth the Mayor and Cr Crichlow have clashed with Robina-based councillor Jan Grew on several issues leading to arguments inside and outside the chamber.\n\nCr Tate’s office was contacted but did not provide a comment before deadline late yesterday.\n\n","byline":"Paul Weston and   Andrew Potts

STANDSTILL \n\nNEWS: GOLDLINQ ADMITS MAJOR LIGHT RAIL RECONSTRUCTION \n\nThe Gold Coast City Council would cover the difference between the cost of testing the near-empty trams and operating them with passengers on board, Cr Tate added.\n\n“When there’s an event at Suncorp Stadium you get extra trains and buses there — the light rail should be activated freely for all marathon runners,” he said.\n\n“That’s in line with state policy and goodwill.\n\n“It will benefit the city and all those out-of-towners from Brisbane and overseas and be fantastic goodwill.”\n\nHowever Mr Emerson’s office last night said it was still waiting on service providers to give their final tick-off — including the council.\n\n“The independent verifier is unable to state when services can commence until it has received the sign-off from major utilities, including Telstra and Energex,” a statement said.\n\n“As of this afternoon we are also still waiting on sign-off from Gold Coast Water, an entity of the Mayor’s own council.”\n\nMajor traffic disruptions are expected during the two-day event, which gained gold level status in January, placing it in the same category as the blockbuster New York, London and Berlin marathons.\n\nLarge swathes of the Gold Coast Highway, including the Sundale Bridge, will be closed for various times between 3.30am and 11am on both days of the event and runners have been encouraged to take advantage of free shuttle buses and regular Surfside routes.\n\nCr Tate said he did not believe the trams’ launch delay was due to safety concerns.\n\n“There have been so many

Assistant Minister for Infrastructure Jamie Briggs and Federal Member for Forde Bert van Manen.\n\n“This has been going on for years,” Mr Dorrington said. “What we need is for people to look outside the square.\n\n“If we can’t get the intersection fixed then maybe we need to look at using drop off zones on the M1 and ferries, then run shuttle buses for the kids.”\n\nCoomera Anglican College principal Mark Sly said he feared someone would be killed at the busy interchange because people often ignored the road rules and cut across the roundabout to avoid traffic.\n\n“We have lots of young, inexperienced drivers from our school negotiating that intersection each day,” he said.\n\n“Even buses cut across.”\n\nCoomera Springs State School teacher Taylor Haley agreed, saying a death or major injury could happen any day.\n\nHighland Reserve State School parents and citizens president Christine Main said there was a near miss on the spot between merging vehicles about every five minutes.\n\nTeressa Foster, who started up the popular Coomera Community Facebook page and is LJ Hooker Coomera principal, said the problem interchange had a serious impact on business in the area.\n\nHer views were supported by Gold Coast Marine identity Bill Barry-Cotter.\n\nMr Barry-Cotter told the Bulletin that his $530 million mixed-use development, earmarked for the Gold Coast marine precinct on the eastern side of the highway, would not go ahead until the problems at Exit 54 were solved.\n\nThe development, which is a joint-venture between Mr Barry-Cotter and developer Property Solutions, will create 4800 jobs during construction and 4600 jobs when complete.\n\n“We are waiting for a deal to be done on Exit 54 before we move ahead,” he said.\n\nThe development of the $500 million Coomera Town Centre, which is estimated to generate 1200 construction jobs and a further 1600 permanent positions, has also been stalled because of the interchange.\n\nYesterday, Mr Briggs agreed to consider finding Federal Government funding for the $60 million road project, but said it should be a State Government responsibility.\n\nHe also visited one of the city’s worst intersections during his trip, Bundall and Ashmore roads, and was asked to help with the upgrade.\n\n","byline":"Lucy Ardern

ASIC aims to bring them into line with legislation relating to responsible lending and overcome avoidance of consumer protection laws and misleading advertising.\n\nIn the past two years, the corporate regulator has launched a string of legal actions against short-term lenders it said were overcharging customers with massive fees, using false or misleading advertising and breaching consumer credit laws.\n\nThe crackdown comes as the Federal Government last month moved to tighten lending laws to stop payday lenders exceeding caps on fees set a year ago, amid huge growth in the online payday lending ­sector.\n\nThe Government and consumer groups have raised concerns similar to ASIC’s that payday lenders who give credit to borrowers with poor credit histories and who can’t get a credit card are taking advantage of those who are most vulnerable.\n\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann last month said payday lenders, which can only lend up to $2000 for short periods, had found ways around the caps on fees set in July 2013 and were contravening 2009 laws which require them to assess whether borrowers would face significant hardship if granted a loan.\n\nASIC said yesterday that Teleloans and Finance & Loans Direct claimed they did not have to comply with certain consumer protection laws under the National Credit Act because their loans came under a short-term credit exemption.\n\nASIC alleges the companies, based on their business models, are not exempt and must comply with the obligations under the National Credit Act relating to caps on fees and charges for payday loans.\n\nASIC said in order for credit providers to meet the short-term credit exemption, a customer cannot be charged more than 5 per cent of the loan amount in fees and 24 per cent in interest per year.\n\nIt will allege the Gold Coast payday lenders had issued five loans in which the combined fees and charges were as high as 160 per cent of the loan amount.\n\nASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell said: “These proceedings will ensure that payday lenders do not deliberately structure their businesses to circumvent laws that protect consumers.\n\n“This is particularly important as the consumers who access these small-amount loans can be financially vulnerable.”\n\nThe proceedings against Teleloans and Finance & Loans Direct are listed for a directions hearing in the Federal Court in Brisbane on July 25.\n\n","byline":"JENNY ROGERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":[],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:01:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T12:16:43.000Z","description":"THE country’s corporate watchdog is taking legal action against two Gold Coast payday lenders, accusing them of avoiding responsible lending obligations after they charged customers fees as high as 160 per cent of the original loan.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/business/asic-takes-teleloans-pty-ltd-and-finance-loans-direct-pty-ltd-to-federal-court/story-fnjc2dm2-1226975719667?sv=82f714b9a793573a20330d8d08e0c459","name":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["goldcoastbulletin.com.au"],"id":"36a70efc43d08d017b215d6d615ebed8","keywords":["short-term credit","test case","legal action","consumer protection laws","short-term credit exemption","responsible lending","short-term credit providers","responsible lending obligations","short-term lenders","raised concerns","credit card","legal actions","Peter Kell","Mathias Cormann","American Family Insurance Group","payday lenders","consumer protection","misleading advertising","corporate watchdog","loan amount","Court action","consumer protection legislation","consumer credit laws","lending laws","Gold Coast","Queensland","Australia","Brisbane","Federal Government","Federal Court"],"kicker":"Test case","link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/business/asic-takes-teleloans-pty-ltd-and-finance-loans-direct-pty-ltd-to-federal-court/story-fnjc2dm2-1226975719667?sv=82f714b9a793573a20330d8d08e0c459","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975719667","originalSource":"GoldCoastBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"4f1a5ed5f00f42b33cde38a688fe07d6","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975718207","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE country’s corporate watchdog is taking ‘test case’ legal action against two Gold Coast payday lenders.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"ASIC takes Teleloans Pty Ltd and Finance & Loans Direct Pty Ltd to Federal Court","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"ASIC goes after Gold Coast lenders","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"26ce0e5c-01e1-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

And you know the person you are talking about wouldn’t want to be labelled with those terms either.\n\nThat he saw himself as just a regular bloke.\n\nBut Scott Sullivan wasn’t ordinary.\n\nHe was brave, he was selfless, he was inspiring. He was the one that covered my rent when as a broke backpacker, I moved into a share house in London. He was the one with the questionable affection for the Spice Girls. Yes, seriously.\n\nThe one with his yellow bomb called “Betsy” parked out the front of that southeast London home that ferried us to rugby games. A home filled with the optimism of being in your early 20s with barely a responsibility in the world with Europe and beyond at your doorstep. The kind of freedom you later realise is fleeting, a place where friendships are forged.\n\nScott or Sully, as everyone knows him, and I became mates in that house. I was just one of his many. Sully was also a son, a brother. He was to become a loving husband to Sarah, a father of two beautiful children, Abbey and Charlie.\n\nHe played rugby, an energetic half-back for Sunnybank, he loved to bark orders at the forwards. He had a special affection for the Rabbitohs, the Reds and Wallabies. He enjoyed a beer or, occasionally, some kind of fruity cocktail. Yes, seriously. He loved his Suncorp job. He loved his life.\n\nBut tragically, that life was cut short. Sully died two months ago. It was the end of a more than three-year battle with motor neurone disease, a cruel condition that kills the nerves that send signals to the muscles that allow us to move, eat, speak and breathe.\n\nThere is no known cure and life expectancy is three to five years after diagnosis. In late April, Sully fell and hit his head at his Brisbane home. He never recovered.\n\nIn the two months since his death there has been tears and laughter, as those that knew and loved Sully started to come to terms with him no longer being here. We’ve all thought a lot about Scott, about friendship and family and what is important in life. It’s been a confronting experience for many of us in our 30s and 40s who had never experienced the grief of losing a friend.\n\nNow I have had a chance to reflect on the life of Scott Sullivan, if there is one word that I believe does sum him up, it is “teacher”. And we will still be learning the lessons he taught us for years to come.\n\nDuring a speech at the inaugural MND Gala Ball in Brisbane in 2011, one of his many initiatives, he mentioned that he often told the risk team he managed at Suncorp that “setbacks were an opportunity to learn”, This was his approach to his diagnosis. Regardless of the outcome he was going to make every moment count.\n\nOnce Sully was told he had a terminal illness in 2010 he exposed his life to the world to give them greater understanding of what he and his family were going through.\n\nIn a similar situation I and probably many others would have retreated into their shell.\n\nNot Sully. He did this, not for his own sake, but for others.\n\nRealising that there was not enough support for those suffering MND, resources for their family members or funds for research, he established the MND and Me Foundation.\n\nNot knowing where to turn himself, he immediately set about putting in place a structure to help ease the stress for others when confronted with the same diagnosis as him.\n\nHe was being educated and we in turn by him.\n\nHis fundraising efforts were tireless. Gala balls, corporate swimming and golf days, media appearances, he even rode a specially modified bike with fellow sufferer Ian Davis, a Melbourne doctor, from Brisbane to Sydney to spread the MND message.\n\nI see the smile on his face as he and Ian cycled into Manly in Sydney, just over 12 months ago. The beers were well earned that night.\n\nTwo weeks pedalling took a toll on his health but, realising time was of the essence, Sully was desperate to ride to raise funds for and awareness about MND.\n\nFor the same reason he completed two Gold Coast Half Marathons after being diagnosed, the first in 2011 and then again in 2012 and, as his legs started to lose strength, he managed the 5.7km challenge last year.\n\nHundreds of thousands of dollars has been poured into research and on June 21 Sully’s vision, the Queensland MND Centre, a place for sufferers, carers, researchers and volunteers, officially opened.\n\nTo me, this resource, which will help thousands of people cope with the most traumatic event in their life, will be a way that they too will come to know Sully in the same way his friends and family knew him.\n\nDespite not being with us anymore, this centre is testament to his generosity and desire to help others. The kind of bloke that would pay the rent of a broke backpacker at a share house in London.\n\nThe last time I saw Scott was the day after the most recent MND Gala Ball in March. Everyone was aware of the toll that the disease was having. He had already had a fall which he was unable to break because his arms no longer functioned. His speech was becoming increasingly hard to understand. For all of us it was heartbreaking but if Sully and his amazing wife Sarah could cope then so could we.\n\nThat afternoon we sat chatting at his house as he drank some sickly alcoholic cider out of a straw. “It’s my new drink,” he told me. He was like that with his drinks. Last time I joined him for breakfast he ordered an iced chocolate with whipped cream. That day, our kids played together and we watched the footy. He was more than likely secretly enjoying the fact that my Eels lost in the last minute.\n\nI realised how lucky I was just to have an hour to sit there and chat and enjoy his company.\n\nWhen I was leaving I said I was looking forward to seeing him on the Gold Coast as one of the dozens of his friends and family that were going to hit the road and raise money for the foundation at the marathon weekend.\n\nSully’s fall happened a month later. We have mourned and continue to but while he won’t be at the starting line this week as he has been for the past three years, trust me, he will be right there running every step with us.\n\n","byline":"Heath Kelly ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/Gold Coast Marathon/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Top News/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Gold Coast News and Galleries/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/","/section/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:17:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T22:33:03.000Z","description":"Brave.

City of Gold Coast chief lifeguard Warren Young said the permanent lifeguards have to pass tough ­physical tests twice a year.\n\n“Our lifeguard service is recognised as a benchmark service, so it’s vitally important we have these tests regularly to uphold our high standards,” he said.\n\n“It is a very challenging course, but our city lifeguards are great athletes and fitness is very important for them to do their job.”\n\nPeta Newbold, 19, was the youngest female lifeguard to take the test and she was proud to have beaten a few of the guys around the challenging course.\n\n“Running was the toughest for me because I’ve never really trained for it,” she said.\n\n“All the lifeguards are pretty fit all year long but it’s good to test yourself.\n\n“We all want to impress the bosses so there might have been some extra training going on.”\n\nMayor Tom Tate said the test was another way to make sure beachgoers were kept safe.\n\n“Our lifeguards are some of the best on the planet, and this tough winter fitness test really keeps them up to scratch,” he said. “When people come to relax and play on our world-famous beaches, they know they’re being looked after by an elite team of professionals.”\n\n","byline":"Shaya Laughlin ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Gold Coast News and Galleries/","/section/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:01:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T21:49:37.000Z","description":"GOLD Coasters awoke to slightly warmer conditions this morning with the mercury rising to 7.1C in the early hours of the morning today.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/gold-coast-chill-eases-as-mercury-climbs-after-one-of-the-citys-coldest-days/story-fnj94ixl-1226975651258?sv=8d0d53fb4e85fa3174607c108accd573","name":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["goldcoastbulletin.com.au"],"id":"7d1f9c45f6382480825fd66f8a8a1f3e","keywords":["world-famous beaches","benchmark service","tog-shrinking cold","surf watchers","elite team","physical tests","test starts","chief lifeguard","Gold Coast","Queensland","Australia","Queensland Council","Fitness Plus","Chris Maynard","winter fitness","fitness test","challenging course","annual winter fitness","youngest female lifeguard","winter fitness test","permanent lifeguards","city lifeguards","test finishes","lifeguard service","gruelling annual winter","board paddle","Scott Franzmann","Warren Young","Matt Austin"],"kicker":"Beach safety","link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/gold-coast-chill-eases-as-mercury-climbs-after-one-of-the-citys-coldest-days/story-fnj94ixl-1226975651258?sv=8d0d53fb4e85fa3174607c108accd573","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975651258","originalAssetId":"1226975651258","originalSource":"GoldCoastBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"7ff06d6ad3dc8705207a015a90e3680f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975956655","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"YOU’RE in safe hands when on famed Gold Coast beaches — the city’s lifeguards have all passed their winter fitness tests.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Gold Coast chill eases as mercury climbs after one of the city’s coldest days","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Michael Batterham"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Coast chill eases as mercury climbs","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"e6fc52c8-01a6-11e4-b272-fb6ce70c69e9 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Picture Mike","Fitness Test","Gold Coast Lifeguards","picture","Mike Batterham"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/goldcoastbulletin/images/1226975956625?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975956625","originalSource":"News Limited","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226975956599","subtitle":"e6fc52c8-01a6-11e4-b272-fb6ce70c69e9","title":"QLD_GCB_NEWS_LIFEGUARDSTEST_02JULY14","width":100},"title":"Coast chill eases as mercury climbs"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"One tram has been sitting near the intersection of Surfers Paradise Blvd and Clifford St, guarded by security for four days.\n\nHow long do you think it will take for the tram to take passengers?

Luke McGinty and punched him in the face in August last year.\n\nThe 33-year-old was stood down without pay following the watch-house incident but is now able to apply to be reinstated after being spared a conviction.\n\nMr Saines said while Bolton had shown no remorse for his behaviour, which was captured on CCTV and witnessed by five other officers, and had taken up valuable court time with his two-day hearing, it would be “wrong to deprive (him) of the opportunity to continue in the police force”.\n\nVictoria Police will decide Bolton’s future.\n\nIn finding Bolton guilty, Mr Saines said the victim Mr McGinty was “clearly and obviously uncooperative”, abusive and taunting but no other officers believed he was a threat.\n\nHe found Bolton’s evidence was “less than reliable” and couldn’t accept his claim that he didn’t realise Mr McGinty was handcuffed until after four officers had restrained him on the floor.\n\n“The accused sought to exaggerate or overstate the sense of danger he felt,” Mr Saines said.\n\n“Even if (Mr McGinty) did say he hated police, taunted some or all of them, I find it was confined to verbal (abuse) and he was not a risk of causing harm to them at any time.”\n\nMr Saines found of the four episodes that made up the charge, only two could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nHe found Bolton’s alleged attempt to knee Mr McGinty and Mr McGinty’s responding alleged bid to kick Bolton were made in the context of both believing they had to defend themselves.\n\nThe court heard Bolton, the most senior officer on staff that night, tried to punch Mr McGinty twice, but accidentally hit a police colleague the second time.\n\nMr Saines said even Mr McGinty’s response to being assaulted and further restrained was “more lighthearted than sinister”.\n\nBolton’s lawyer described the assault as “15 seconds of behaviour uncharacteristic to 33 years of service”.\n\n“He’s achieved a great deal of good in the Colac community,” he said, listing the creation of the Beechy Trek with disadvantaged youth and anti-drugs competition Ride to the Rock and numerous certificates of appreciation.\n\nMr Saines said Bolton’s good character and years of service in an “onerous and thankless job” mitigated against his poor decision.\n\n“You crossed the line; you didn’t cross it by a terribly long way or in a way that caused any significant injury but nevertheless you crossed a line that everyone in the criminal justice system understands,” he said.\n\nBolton was fined $1500 without conviction.\n\n","byline":"Anthea Cannon

Victorians living along the line had access to fast and frequent train travel to places other than Melbourne.\n\n“The Greens support a staged reintroduction of passenger services with existing stations reopened if possible and other new low-cost stations constructed where required,” Mr Barber said.\n\n“We know that people want to travel between regional cities for work, education, health and recreation, so it isn’t enough for trains to only connect with Melbourne.”\n\nHowever the party has not provided any of their own costings for the project, except to say that consultant and lobby group activist Noel Laidlaw completed an independent study which found reopening the line to a basic service would cost around $90 million. \n\nThe state government Rail Revival Feasibility Study estimated the cost of a full reopening would be between $760-$935 million.\n\nMr Barber said the first stage should be to reopen the Geelong to Ballarat rail line, with new low-cost stations at Bannockburn and Meredith to provide a commuter service for those fast-growing communities.\n\nThey estimate a 65-minute moderate-speed service could be achieved with some new tracks, upgrades to level crossings and one passing loop.\n\nStage two would be to repair and rebuild the train line between Maryborough and Castlemaine and stage three would include upgrading to a faster and more regular service that could continue on existing tracks to Bendigo. \n\n“While we would love super-fast Goldfields trains, an affordable basic service would be preferable to none at all and still fast enough to compete with car travel,” Mr Barber said.\n\n“V/Line buses are the only public transport for many towns along the line but they are unable to offer a viable commuter service.”\n\nMr Barber said freight trains still use sections of the track and could share some of the upgrade costs.\n\nHe said a return to train travel would encourage more people to move to regional Victoria and be more beneficial for residents than the $18 billion East-West toll road.\n\nCommunity group Rail Revival Alliance has been lobbying the Government to reopen the line since last year.\n\nAbout 200 people attended a rally at the now unused Carisbrook Station, about 150km north of Geelong, in December last year.\n\n","byline":"NICOLE MILLS

from the Waterfront bollards to Balyang Sanctuary.\n\nHe has recently compiled hundreds of stunning images into an 82-page book prototype titled Unseen Geelong, which he is hoping to launch later this year.\n\n“Geelong I think is really undervalued, there’s a lot of beauty there with or without infra-red, and honestly people miss it, they just don’t see it,” he said.\n\n“I like to capture things you can’t see, or show a different view of things you can see.”\n\nGeelong’s “Lightsmith” started taking photography seriously in 2007 when he took a redundancy from Ford, and said most of his photos are taken on his travels between Lara and Geelong to visit his elderly parents in hospital.\n\n“I was always interested in general light photography but I have to say I wasn’t very good at it, it was almost as though something was missing and I could never really work out what it was until I started taking infra-red,” he said.\n\n“I saw my first infra-red picture and said ‘that’s it, that’s what I should be doing’, so I look for opportunities everywhere.”\n\nMr Moore said he sat down with Geelong mayor Darryn Lyons last week who was supportive of the project, and Moore hoped others would appreciate the images.\n\n“It came to me that I had all these pictures of Geelong, I don’t want them to just sit there I want people to see them,” he said.\n\n“I thought I should put them together in a book as a way of making Geelong more accessible, and maybe it will make people notice things a little more.”\n\nTo check out more of Mr Moore’s striking photographs visit

offer.\n\nWith the new device expected to be launched in two months, news.com.au has pulled together the best early indications of what to expect with the new model.\n\nAlthough Apple hasn’t confirmed any of these rumours, leaked images suggest these are the most likely features.\n\nHere’s what to expect from the iPhone 6.\n\n1. Super-size me\n\nThe most prevalent rumour about the new iPhone 6 is that Apple will, in fact, release two versions of the smartphone. There is set to be two different-sized models to be launched at the same time: a standard 4.7-inch model and an oversized 5.5-inch. The larger version is expected to be $100 more expensive but offer a better camera and a higher storage capacity.\n\n2. More brain power\n\nThe larger iPhone could have up to 128GB in storage capacity, according to Mac Rumours. Tech site 9to5Mac reports that the smaller version is expected to be released with 32GB and 64GB storage options.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nA larger body means a larger screen. As we reported early in the week, Australian market research firm Telsyte has found that Apple could lose almost half its potential iPhone 6 customer base if it simply pumped out another smartphone with roughly the same screen size. So it’s pleasing to hear the customers will have the choice of a 4.7-inch or a 5.5-inch display, which eclipses the iPhone 5S’s four inches. This will allow the iPhone 6 to better compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches), Sony Xperia Z2 (5.2 inches), LG G3 (5.5 inches) and Nokia Lumia 930 Windows 8 (5 inches). The screen could also go virtually to the edges of the phone for the first time.\n\niPhone 6 leak: metal case reveals same new #iPhone #design lines - http://t.co/3tL468vYfg pic.twitter.com/E6HKn3YLLs\n\n— HiddenRadio (@HiddenRadio) July 2, 2014 \n\n4. This baby’s got curves\n\nThe new model is likely to do away with the flat edges on the iPhone 4 and 5 and adopt a more curvaceous body. Expect a rounder design with curved edges.\n\n5. Slimline \n\nThe body of the phone is also expected to be much thinner than the iPhone 5S and more closely resemble the iPod touch. The slimline design is also expected to result in a lighter device.\n\n6. Glossy \n\nLeaked photographs show that the screen and body has a sleek, glossy finish. There are also rumours that the screen will be made of sapphire crystal, which will make it more resistant to scratches.\n\n7. What shall I call thee?\n\nThe new model is believed to be called the iPhone Air.\n\n8. Snap happy\n\nThe iPhone 6 is expected to have a better camera with more megapixels so it can better compete with its rivals. The phone is also likely to have superior image stabilisation, which helps users take clearer pictures while moving.\n\n9. I can see clearly now\n\nThe 4.7-inch screen is rumoured to have a clearer 1704-by-960 pixel resolution.\n\n10. Camera switcheroo\n\nThe front-facing camera appears to be back on the left-side of the ear speaker, similar to where it was for the iPhone 4. (It was above the earpiece for the iPhone 5.)\n\nThe latest rumours suggest the iPhone 6 will be launched on September 9.\n\n","byline":"JAMES LAW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/Smartphones/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/Gadgets/Mobile Phones/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/Gadgets/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/Smartphones/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/couriermail.com.au/technology/","/section/couriermail.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/news.com.au/technology/","/section/news.com.au/technology/gadgets/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/technology/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/perthnow.com.au/technology/","/section/perthnow.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/technology/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/technology/smartphones/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T00:43:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T00:43:27.000Z","description":"A BIGGER screen.

and facial features of an Asian woman on a Sydney to Newcastle train on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe incident was filmed by a passenger and posted on YouTube. The woman became angry at two young children when they didn’t give their seats up for her.\n\nShe then began to abuse other passengers, including a man who was sitting next to an Asian woman. “Who is this little jerk-off? He can only get a gook - he can’t even get a regular girlfriend. It is so sad,” she said, as passengers groaned in offence.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan, he has got a gook.”\n\nAfter she caused a scene inside the carriage, police spoke to the woman when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney’s west.\n\n“There were police patrolling from a local area command,” police transport command assistant commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.\n\n“They were there for another matter, unaware of the full circumstances of this situation.\n\nPolice spoke to the woman but decided to let her “go about her journey”, Mr Mitchell said.\n\nMr Mitchell didn’t know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed the woman would be charged for her “abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour”.\n\n“The person responsible will be prosecuted,” he said.\n\nIf found guilty of offensive behaviour, she faces a $500 fine.\n\n“This person has committed offensive behaviour,” Mr Mitchell said.\n\n“It is a crime that we will not tolerate, particularly in regards to the racial motivation behind this incident.”\n\nThe woman told ninemsn she had a rotten day and had been scammed out of $100,000 from a man she had met on a dating website.\n\nSydney Trains chief Howard Collins said he was “shocked” by the rant and the company would be working with police to investigate.\n\n“I’m just amazed - we’ve got to stamp this out,” he said.\n\nIn April, Rebecca Blessington, 28, was charged after allegedly racially abusing two Asian women on a train from Town Hall to Bondi\n\nJade Marr boarded the train at Central Station when Ms Wilkins told her two children and two nephews, aged between four and 10, to get off the seats.\n\n“I was in shock at the time. I’m probably more angry today that someone could be that low and attack a child or anyone else.\n\n“Everyone took it seriously but it actually became quite comical, it was just ridiculous.”\n\n“We were just thinking ‘what are you doing’? It was unbelievable.\n\n“She called the police and her goal was to get my children removed from the train because they were sitting on a seat.\n\n“We don’t catch the train very often so the kids were worried they had done the wrong thing. \n\nPOLICE CHARGE WOMAN OVER RACISTS RANT \n\nRACIST RANT ON SYDNEY BUS CAUGHT ON CAMERA \n\nTAMARAMA SURF VICTIM WAS FATHER OF TWO \n\nTHREE CHARGED OVER CROWN WITNESS KILLING \n\n“They were frightened that the police were coming to get them. I just kept telling them that they hadn’t done anything wrong and that this woman was not responding the way that normal people do.\n\n“My nephew was really concerned about the words she was using and the way she spoke to the other woman.\n\n“The kids just didn’t understand why someone would say that.”\n\nMs Wilkins was in apologetic mood this afternoon.\n\n“I had a rotten day,’ she told Ninemsn . ‘I’ve been chasing work for quite some time now,” she said.\n\n“It’s awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,” Ms Wilkins said.\n\nWilkins became enraged at some young children after they did not give into her demands for a seat on a morning Central Coast train.\n\nShe then started abusing passengers including an Asian woman and a man who stood up for her.\n\n“Who is this little jerk off he can only get a gook, he can’t even get a regular girlfriend — it is so sad,” she said.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan he has got a gook — look at it. She probably thinks he is rich.”\n\nThe video was posted onto YouTube by user Kareem Abdul.\n\n“On the Central coast & Newcastle line in peak hour during school holidays,” Abdul wrote.\n\n“I started filming as the woman became aggressive toward some children (ages 12 and under) who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded.\n\n“This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids.\n\n“The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her and now the lady is calling the police … Because the kids didn’t move?”\n\n","byline":"Ben Pike and Ian Walker

Fevola pull on a Cheetah’s guernsey on Saturday and West president Simon Cavallo said the club would consider luring another marquee man.\n\n“I won’t say no to anything,” Cavallo said.\n\n“I’d like to leave our options open. He’s probably the biggest drawcard, I don’t think there’s any bigger than Fev.”\n\nRain put a dampener on the Cheetahs’ plans to lure thousands to West Oval for the EJ Whitten Foundation fundraiser.\n\n“It could’ve been spectacular, but it was 11C and the showers came at one o’clock when everyone would’ve been decided whether or not to go,” Cavallo said.\n\n“So it was a bit disappointing but we’ll definitely try something similar in the future.”\n\nFevola was spotted at Home House nightclub in the early hours of Saturday morning but Cavallo said the club was unfazed but his late night out.\n\n“Fev’s been in the business a long time and he knows his capabilities and he has a bit of a rock star attitude,” Cavallo said.\n\n“We would trust that he undertakes his actions knowing his capabilities. On the day he was completely fine, so we’ve got no problems with anything the night before as far as his performance was concerned.\n\n“The delivery and conditions and the quality opponents that he played on made it difficult for him, so I’m not sure that if he went to bed at 8.30pm it would’ve made much of a difference.”\n\nFevola missed a club breakfast but Cavallo said the former AFL star was not required at the function.\n\n“There’s a lot of rumours going around and I’m not sure what’s true but from 12 noon when he arrived, Fev was a complete professional,” Cavallo said.\n\n“He was everything and more than we could’ve asked for. He signed close to 100 autographs and posed for an equal amount of photos with his fans. He was awesome.\n\n“He was enthusiastic and positive and never said no to anyone. He gave his complete time and attention to everyone.”\n\n","byline":"ALEX OATES ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Local

range of collectables that auctioneers expect to fetch more than $500,000.\n\nHoward’s items ranged from the valuable to the bizarre, with possessions including stuffed bears and a 1920s strongman machine.\n\nGeelong businessman Mark Ward is one of the few people the 84-year-old spoke to.\n\nHe will host the auction at his Ballarat Mill Markets venue after being approached by Howard’s wife, Barbara.\n\n“I was one of the very few people who Bill invited inside for a cup of tea,” Ward said.\n\nAccording to Ward, the sale has created international interest.\n\n“It’s probably the best collectable auction to ever be sold from one vendor in Australia,” Ward said.\n\nOne of the antiques expected to receive strong bids is a giant handpainted poster from the Palais Theatre, which Ward anticipates will be sold for more than $10,000.\n\nWhile Howard’s treasures were eye-catching and rare, Ward said his friend did not often show them to people.\n\n“Everyone knew of Bill’s collection, but the real quirky thing is no-one was ever able to see it,” he said.\n\nHoward’s obsession with collectables dated back to the early 1970s, when he settled in Ballarat with his wife and four children after years spent travelling the world.\n\nShortly after becoming an auctioneer at Mid Western Auctions, Howard bought out the business.\n\nHe regularly held general auctions which became known for his top hat and the 1935 Dodge hearse parked outside, where an artificial leg protruding from a coffin was a common sight.\n\nHoward eventually retired and sold his business in 1984, but continued collecting items until his death last year.\n\nDuring his lifetime, his home near Sovereign Hill became known as an overflowing “Aladdin’s Cave” filled with some of the most unique collectables.\n\nBut despite the money Howard could have made by selling his possessions, Ward said that was not an option for the hoarder.\n\n“All his life, he never sold anything,” Ward said. “He just collected.”\n\nThe man tasked with auctioning off Howard’s prized collection is renowned seller Graham Lancaster, who has flown with a team from Queensland for the two-day sale.\n\nMore than 880 lots will be sold across Saturday and Sunday.\n\nTaking pride of place in the auction room as items go under the hammer will be Howard’s trademark top hat and his beloved penny-farthing — each of which are up for grabs.\n\n","byline":"Rusty Woodger ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong News and

I’ve gazed into a crystal ball and some things I liked and some things I didn’t.\n\nWhat I do like is having the field cleared of everyone except players and umpires when the ball is in play.\n\nAt the moment the runners and waterboys are getting in the way. This year cutting the runners from two to one for each club has meant delivering coaches’ messages is a bit tougher. But there have still been incidents where runners are getting in the way of the play.\n\nI think it’s just a matter of time before no one is allowed on the field except after a goal is kicked. It’ll declutter the field and that’s good for footy.\n\nAnother decluttering tool I think the AFL will have trialled is introducing zones. Former West Coast premiership coach John Worsfold would not have mentioned bringing in this critical game changer if his new colleagues on the AFL Rules Committee hadn’t given it serious consideration.\n\nCoaches and fans are crying out that the game looks ugly with 36 players following the ball around without having the traditional backmen on forwards and wingmen sticking to their side of the ground.\n\nI don’t think zoning will be implemented into the AFL but I do see it being trialled in preseason competitions and being used more and more at junior levels.\n\nAnother crucial change I believe will continue to be manipulated will be the number of interchange rotations. I see the cap being reduced to as low as 40 by season 2020.\n\nThese days players are fitter, stronger and have greater capacity to run out games and these attributes will be viewed so highly by clubs because they’ll need players to still be running at full pace in the dying moments of the fourth quarter.\n\nI don’t see 10 rotations a quarter being a problem. When I was playing there were some games when players sat on the pine the whole game. It wasn’t a problem then and I can’t see it being a massive problem in the future.\n\nOne rule I do like, which incorporates the rotation figures, is the concussion rule. As research into this area of sports medicine continues to improve I think we may see more players wearing helmets. The experts are saying that at the moment wearing a helmet doesn’t decrease the likelihood of concussion, but with another six years of studies we may have different outcomes.\n\nWhat I do know is more players, here in the AFL and over in the NFL, will have developed significant brain injuries from playing the sport with such intensity and getting knocked out numerous times. We are in the hands of the doctors with this one, but the more research that can be done, the better.\n\nThis week the AFL has cancelled any future plans for Sunday night football. Good. They’ve listened to the fans on this one. I think we’ll see the game played more on Thursday nights, and I’d love to see a return to the tradition 2.10pm start on a Saturday.\n\nEngaging the fans will be the legacy of Gillon McLachlan’s legacy as chief executive. He’s started very well in his first six weeks in the job.\n\nMcLachlan will have to be really strong in his leadership as soccer will continue to increase in popularity in the country.\n\nThe efforts at this year’s World Cup have given the round ball game a significant boost and the FFA will have another big boost if Australia can win the Asian Cup next year.\n\nAFL will have to look at the junior sports to ensure kids are still coming through the ranks because the dollars on offer for talented youngsters to play soccer overseas will be such a lure for them.\n\nAFL salaries are nothing to be sneezed at, but if a kid has the chance to play for Manchester United or Hawthorn, it’d be a significant business decision for the young bloke.\n\nAnd a couple of quirky predictions as we look to 2020. All the players were wearing black boots. Remember them?\n\nIt used to make news when a player, like the flamboyant Warwick Capper sported white boots. Wow, what a showman he was. Dermott Brereton loved to show off his white leather feet.\n\nHow things change, now you look out of place if you don’t have white ones, or blue ones, or yellow ones, or if you’re Bernie Vince you wear one pink boot and one blue boot.\n\nI can foresee the players going “retro” and returning to the days of black.\n\nGreater Western Sydney will have won back-to-back premierships, every player will have a tattoo and Dustin Fletcher will still be playing for Essendon.\n\nYou never know, I might be right on some of this. Time will tell.\n\n","byline":"DAVID SCHWARZ ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Footy Experts/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Homepage Rotators/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T15:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T01:24:46.000Z","description":"AS the AFL gets ready to instigate a Charter to protect the fundamentals of our great game, I think it’s time we look to the future and make some predictions of where our game is headed.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/my-2020-vision-for-the-afl/story-fnjuhrq4-1226975558484?sv=91e9c2904e4d4681d45b1a9df3643f9","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"764c093047c36051b0b8f322f6074f8c","keywords":["talented youngsters","wingmen sticking","preseason competitions","white boots","traditional backmen","decluttering tool","business decision","Greater Western Sydney Giants","Manchester United Football Club","National Football League","Australian Football League","Dustin Fletcher","crystal ball","interchange rotations","players wearing helmets","mentioned bringing","game changer","white leather feet","rotation figures","Bernie Vince","game heads","dying moments","game looks","players sat","black boots","John Worsfold","David Schwarz","Gillon McLachlan","Dermott Brereton","Warwick Capper"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/my-2020-vision-for-the-afl/story-fnjuhrq4-1226975558484?sv=91e9c2904e4d4681d45b1a9df3643f9","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975558484","originalAssetId":"1226975558484","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Footy Experts/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ca5f1e342accb67ff6e693a0682e2766","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975557744","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"I HAVE looked into my crystal ball and I see the cap on interchange being reduced to as low as 40.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"My 2020 vision for the AFL ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Glenn Ferguson"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"My 2020 vision for the AFL ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8b942022-01c5-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["football columnists","Geelong Advertiser","football","columnists","David Schwarz"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/geelongadvertiser/images/1226976266515?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976266515","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226976266489","subtitle":"8b942022-01c5-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac","title":"Geelong Advertiser football columnists","width":100},"title":"My 2020 vision for the AFL"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"The Geelong Magistrates’ Court heard yesterday Neil Hogg, who is on the sex offenders register for life, was spotted sitting opposite the primary school drinking a can of beer while children passed close by to exit the grounds on April 30.\n\nDays later the 54-year-old was again seen in the area, this time talking to two five-year-old girls.\n\nThe police prosecutor told the court Hogg admitted to police his actions were “pretty dangerous”.\n\nThe court heard Hogg’s history of offending was well known and that a large number of people in Winchelsea are now fearful of their children’s safety.\n\nHogg’s lawyer Tim Fitzgerald said his client suffered from extremely low cognitive function and there were grave fears for his safety if jailed.\n\n“It’s readily apparent that alcohol plays a significant contributing role. It’s a blight that’s been cast on Mr Hogg’s life,” he said.\n\nMr Fitzgerald said his client had previously been unable to complete any community service work handed down to him as part of his community corrections order due to two assaults in four months, one that left him with life-threatening head injuries.\n\nIn January, Hogg was flown to a Melbourne hospital after allegedly being assaulted with a shovel in Geelong West.\n\nMr Fitzgerald said, while Hogg was recovering in hospital, his house was set alight.\n\nMagistrate Ron Saines said a suspended jail term was crucial in preventing repeat offending, but told Hogg he would head straight to prison if he failed to comply or follow treatments.\n\n“This is a very serious matter, being drunk outside a school in Winchelsea after being sentenced many times for loitering and offences that make many people concerned about their children’s safety,” Mr Saines said.\n\n“Were it not for the difficulties you have in understanding, with your disabilities, you’d go to jail for a long time.\n\n“In circumstances where a guilty plea has been given at an early date, a jail sentence should not be imposed unless there is no other option.”\n\nMr Saines also imposed a revised two-year community corrections order that will see Hogg required to do 100 hours of work during 12 months, and undergo treatment for alcohol abuse.\n\n","byline":"ERIN PEARSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong Crime and Court/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Top News/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:52:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T22:57:07.000Z","description":"A CONVICTED sex offender has been handed a two-month suspended jail term after he pleaded guilty to twice loitering while drunk near a Winchelsea primary school.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/serial-sex-offender-handed-suspended-sentence-after-being-nabbed-near-winchelsea-primary-school/story-fnjuhoxe-1226974672822?sv=77309cfd17953b224c6988e0a1a716d8","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"d25d382f5777489ca6b72c8a769f9397","keywords":["sex offender","Convicted sex offender","jail term","sex offenders register","suspended jail term","jail sentence","community service work","alcohol abuse","police prosecution","watching children","police cells","Geelong West","Victoria","Australia","Melbourne hospital","Tim Fitzgerald","Neil Hogg","suspended sentence","community service","Serial sex offender","community corrections order"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/serial-sex-offender-handed-suspended-sentence-after-being-nabbed-near-winchelsea-primary-school/story-fnjuhoxe-1226974672822?sv=77309cfd17953b224c6988e0a1a716d8","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974672822","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong Crime and Court/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"534620af3f08ba8eeb091a3d82aa2996","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974672777","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"CONVICTED sex offender Neil Hogg, 54, has been handed a two-month suspended jail term after he pleaded guilty to twice loitering drunk near a Winchelsea primary school.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Serial sex offender handed suspended sentence after being nabbed near Winchelsea primary school","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Alison Wynd"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Child sex offender loitered at school","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6cae6bba-00d8-11e4-b272-fb6ce70c69e9 -

Luke McGinty and punched him in the face in August last year.\n\nThe 33-year-old was stood down without pay following the watch-house incident but is now able to apply to be reinstated after being spared a conviction.\n\nMr Saines said while Bolton had shown no remorse for his behaviour, which was captured on CCTV and witnessed by five other officers, and had taken up valuable court time with his two-day hearing, it would be “wrong to deprive (him) of the opportunity to continue in the police force”.\n\nVictoria Police will decide Bolton’s future.\n\nIn finding Bolton guilty, Mr Saines said the victim Mr McGinty was “clearly and obviously uncooperative”, abusive and taunting but no other officers believed he was a threat.\n\nHe found Bolton’s evidence was “less than reliable” and couldn’t accept his claim that he didn’t realise Mr McGinty was handcuffed until after four officers had restrained him on the floor.\n\n“The accused sought to exaggerate or overstate the sense of danger he felt,” Mr Saines said.\n\n“Even if (Mr McGinty) did say he hated police, taunted some or all of them, I find it was confined to verbal (abuse) and he was not a risk of causing harm to them at any time.”\n\nMr Saines found of the four episodes that made up the charge, only two could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nHe found Bolton’s alleged attempt to knee Mr McGinty and Mr McGinty’s responding alleged bid to kick Bolton were made in the context of both believing they had to defend themselves.\n\nThe court heard Bolton, the most senior officer on staff that night, tried to punch Mr McGinty twice, but accidentally hit a police colleague the second time.\n\nMr Saines said even Mr McGinty’s response to being assaulted and further restrained was “more lighthearted than sinister”.\n\nBolton’s lawyer described the assault as “15 seconds of behaviour uncharacteristic to 33 years of service”.\n\n“He’s achieved a great deal of good in the Colac community,” he said, listing the creation of the Beechy Trek with disadvantaged youth and anti-drugs competition Ride to the Rock and numerous certificates of appreciation.\n\nMr Saines said Bolton’s good character and years of service in an “onerous and thankless job” mitigated against his poor decision.\n\n“You crossed the line; you didn’t cross it by a terribly long way or in a way that caused any significant injury but nevertheless you crossed a line that everyone in the criminal justice system understands,” he said.\n\nBolton was fined $1500 without conviction.\n\n","byline":"Anthea Cannon

Moore, 53, has been shining a new light on local landmarks from the Waterfront bollards to Balyang Sanctuary.\n\nHe has recently compiled hundreds of stunning images into an 82-page book prototype titled Unseen Geelong, which he is hoping to launch later this year.\n\n“Geelong I think is really undervalued, there’s a lot of beauty there with or without infra-red, and honestly people miss it, they just don’t see it,” he said.\n\n“I like to capture things you can’t see, or show a different view of things you can see.”\n\nGeelong’s “Lightsmith” started taking photography seriously in 2007 when he took a redundancy from Ford, and said most of his photos are taken on his travels between Lara and Geelong to visit his elderly parents in hospital.\n\n“I was always interested in general light photography but I have to say I wasn’t very good at it, it was almost as though something was missing and I could never really work out what it was until I started taking infra-red,” he said.\n\n“I saw my first infra-red picture and said ‘that’s it, that’s what I should be doing’, so I look for opportunities everywhere.”\n\nMr Moore said he sat down with Geelong mayor Darryn Lyons last week who was supportive of the project, and Moore hoped others would appreciate the images.\n\n“It came to me that I had all these pictures of Geelong, I don’t want them to just sit there I want people to see them,” he said.\n\n“I thought I should put them together in a book as a way of making Geelong more accessible, and maybe it will make people notice things a little more.”\n\nTo check out more of Mr Moore’s striking photographs visit thelightsmith.com.\n\n","byline":"Bethany Tyler ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong

Victorians living along the line had access to fast and frequent train travel to places other than Melbourne.\n\n“The Greens support a staged reintroduction of passenger services with existing stations reopened if possible and other new low-cost stations constructed where required,” Mr Barber said.\n\n“We know that people want to travel between regional cities for work, education, health and recreation, so it isn’t enough for trains to only connect with Melbourne.”\n\nHowever the party has not provided any of their own costings for the project, except to say that consultant and lobby group activist Noel Laidlaw completed an independent study which found reopening the line to a basic service would cost around $90 million. \n\nThe state government Rail Revival Feasibility Study estimated the cost of a full reopening would be between $760-$935 million.\n\nMr Barber said the first stage should be to reopen the Geelong to Ballarat rail line, with new low-cost stations at Bannockburn and Meredith to provide a commuter service for those fast-growing communities.\n\nThey estimate a 65-minute moderate-speed service could be achieved with some new tracks, upgrades to level crossings and one passing loop.\n\nStage two would be to repair and rebuild the train line between Maryborough and Castlemaine and stage three would include upgrading to a faster and more regular service that could continue on existing tracks to Bendigo. \n\n“While we would love super-fast Goldfields trains, an affordable basic service would be preferable to none at all and still fast enough to compete with car travel,” Mr Barber said.\n\n“V/Line buses are the only public transport for many towns along the line but they are unable to offer a viable commuter service.”\n\nMr Barber said freight trains still use sections of the track and could share some of the upgrade costs.\n\nHe said a return to train travel would encourage more people to move to regional Victoria and be more beneficial for residents than the $18 billion East-West toll road.\n\nCommunity group Rail Revival Alliance has been lobbying the Government to reopen the line since last year.\n\nAbout 200 people attended a rally at the now unused Carisbrook Station, about 150km north of Geelong, in December last year.\n\n","byline":"NICOLE MILLS

On the day he was completely fine, so we’ve got no problems with anything the night before as far as his performance was concerned.\n\n“The delivery and conditions and the quality opponents that he played on made it difficult for him, so I’m not sure that if he went to bed at 8.30pm it would’ve made much of a difference.”\n\nFevola missed a club breakfast but Cavallo said the former AFL star was not required at the function.\n\n“There’s a lot of rumours going around and I’m not sure what’s true but from 12 noon when he arrived, Fev was a complete professional,” Cavallo said.\n\n“He was everything and more than we could’ve asked for. He signed close to 100 autographs and posed for an equal amount of photos with his fans. He was awesome.\n\n“He was enthusiastic and positive and never said no to anyone.

It’s a blight that’s been cast on Mr Hogg’s life,” he said.\n\nMr Fitzgerald said his client had previously been unable to complete any community service work handed down to him as part of his community corrections order due to two assaults in four months, one that left him with life-threatening head injuries.\n\nIn January, Hogg was flown to a Melbourne hospital after allegedly being assaulted with a shovel in Geelong West.\n\nMr Fitzgerald said, while Hogg was recovering in hospital, his house was set alight.\n\nMagistrate Ron Saines said a suspended jail term was crucial in preventing repeat offending, but told Hogg he would head straight to prison if he failed to comply or follow treatments.\n\n“This is a very serious matter, being drunk outside a school in Winchelsea after being sentenced many times for loitering and offences that make many people concerned about their children’s safety,” Mr Saines said.\n\n“Were it not for the difficulties you have in understanding, with your disabilities, you’d go to jail for a long time.\n\n“In circumstances where a guilty plea has been given at an early date, a jail sentence should not be imposed unless there is no other option.”\n\nMr Saines also imposed a revised two-year community corrections order that will see Hogg required to do 100 hours of work during 12 months, and undergo treatment for alcohol abuse.\n\n","byline":"ERIN PEARSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong Crime and Court/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Top News/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:52:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T22:57:07.000Z","description":"A CONVICTED sex offender has been handed a two-month suspended jail term after he pleaded guilty to twice loitering while drunk near a Winchelsea primary school.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/serial-sex-offender-handed-suspended-sentence-after-being-nabbed-near-winchelsea-primary-school/story-fnjuhoxe-1226974672822?sv=77309cfd17953b224c6988e0a1a716d8","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"d25d382f5777489ca6b72c8a769f9397","keywords":["sex offender","Convicted sex offender","jail term","sex offenders register","suspended jail term","jail sentence","community service work","alcohol abuse","police prosecution","watching children","police cells","Geelong West","Victoria","Australia","Melbourne hospital","Tim Fitzgerald","Neil Hogg","suspended sentence","community service","Serial sex offender","community corrections order"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/crime-court/serial-sex-offender-handed-suspended-sentence-after-being-nabbed-near-winchelsea-primary-school/story-fnjuhoxe-1226974672822?sv=77309cfd17953b224c6988e0a1a716d8","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974672822","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong Crime and Court/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"534620af3f08ba8eeb091a3d82aa2996","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974672777","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"CONVICTED sex offender Neil Hogg, 54, has been handed a two-month suspended jail term after he pleaded guilty to twice loitering drunk near a Winchelsea primary school.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Serial sex offender handed suspended sentence after being nabbed near Winchelsea primary school","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Alison Wynd"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Child sex offender loitered at school","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6cae6bba-00d8-11e4-b272-fb6ce70c69e9 -

I’ve gazed into a crystal ball and some things I liked and some things I didn’t.\n\nWhat I do like is having the field cleared of everyone except players and umpires when the ball is in play.\n\nAt the moment the runners and waterboys are getting in the way. This year cutting the runners from two to one for each club has meant delivering coaches’ messages is a bit tougher. But there have still been incidents where runners are getting in the way of the play.\n\nI think it’s just a matter of time before no one is allowed on the field except after a goal is kicked. It’ll declutter the field and that’s good for footy.\n\nAnother decluttering tool I think the AFL will have trialled is introducing zones. Former West Coast premiership coach John Worsfold would not have mentioned bringing in this critical game changer if his new colleagues on the AFL Rules Committee hadn’t given it serious consideration.\n\nCoaches and fans are crying out that the game looks ugly with 36 players following the ball around without having the traditional backmen on forwards and wingmen sticking to their side of the ground.\n\nI don’t think zoning will be implemented into the AFL but I do see it being trialled in preseason competitions and being used more and more at junior levels.\n\nAnother crucial change I believe will continue to be manipulated will be the number of interchange rotations. I see the cap being reduced to as low as 40 by season 2020.\n\nThese days players are fitter, stronger and have greater capacity to run out games and these attributes will be viewed so highly by clubs because they’ll need players to still be running at full pace in the dying moments of the fourth quarter.\n\nI don’t see 10 rotations a quarter being a problem. When I was playing there were some games when players sat on the pine the whole game. It wasn’t a problem then and I can’t see it being a massive problem in the future.\n\nOne rule I do like, which incorporates the rotation figures, is the concussion rule. As research into this area of sports medicine continues to improve I think we may see more players wearing helmets. The experts are saying that at the moment wearing a helmet doesn’t decrease the likelihood of concussion, but with another six years of studies we may have different outcomes.\n\nWhat I do know is more players, here in the AFL and over in the NFL, will have developed significant brain injuries from playing the sport with such intensity and getting knocked out numerous times. We are in the hands of the doctors with this one, but the more research that can be done, the better.\n\nThis week the AFL has cancelled any future plans for Sunday night football. Good. They’ve listened to the fans on this one. I think we’ll see the game played more on Thursday nights, and I’d love to see a return to the tradition 2.10pm start on a Saturday.\n\nEngaging the fans will be the legacy of Gillon McLachlan’s legacy as chief executive. He’s started very well in his first six weeks in the job.\n\nMcLachlan will have to be really strong in his leadership as soccer will continue to increase in popularity in the country.\n\nThe efforts at this year’s World Cup have given the round ball game a significant boost and the FFA will have another big boost if Australia can win the Asian Cup next year.\n\nAFL will have to look at the junior sports to ensure kids are still coming through the ranks because the dollars on offer for talented youngsters to play soccer overseas will be such a lure for them.\n\nAFL salaries are nothing to be sneezed at, but if a kid has the chance to play for Manchester United or Hawthorn, it’d be a significant business decision for the young bloke.\n\nAnd a couple of quirky predictions as we look to 2020. All the players were wearing black boots. Remember them?\n\nIt used to make news when a player, like the flamboyant Warwick Capper sported white boots. Wow, what a showman he was. Dermott Brereton loved to show off his white leather feet.\n\nHow things change, now you look out of place if you don’t have white ones, or blue ones, or yellow ones, or if you’re Bernie Vince you wear one pink boot and one blue boot.\n\nI can foresee the players going “retro” and returning to the days of black.\n\nGreater Western Sydney will have won back-to-back premierships, every player will have a tattoo and Dustin Fletcher will still be playing for Essendon.\n\nYou never know, I might be right on some of this. Time will tell.\n\n","byline":"DAVID SCHWARZ ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Footy Experts/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Homepage Rotators/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T15:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T01:24:46.000Z","description":"AS the AFL gets ready to instigate a Charter to protect the fundamentals of our great game, I think it’s time we look to the future and make some predictions of where our game is headed.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/my-2020-vision-for-the-afl/story-fnjuhrq4-1226975558484?sv=91e9c2904e4d4681d45b1a9df3643f9","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"764c093047c36051b0b8f322f6074f8c","keywords":["talented youngsters","wingmen sticking","preseason competitions","white boots","traditional backmen","decluttering tool","business decision","Greater Western Sydney Giants","Manchester United Football Club","National Football League","Australian Football League","Dustin Fletcher","crystal ball","interchange rotations","players wearing helmets","mentioned bringing","game changer","white leather feet","rotation figures","Bernie Vince","game heads","dying moments","game looks","players sat","black boots","John Worsfold","David Schwarz","Gillon McLachlan","Dermott Brereton","Warwick Capper"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/my-2020-vision-for-the-afl/story-fnjuhrq4-1226975558484?sv=91e9c2904e4d4681d45b1a9df3643f9","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975558484","originalAssetId":"1226975558484","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Footy Experts/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ca5f1e342accb67ff6e693a0682e2766","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975557744","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"I HAVE looked into my crystal ball and I see the cap on interchange being reduced to as low as 40.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"My 2020 vision for the AFL ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Glenn Ferguson"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"My 2020 vision for the AFL ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8b942022-01c5-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["football columnists","Geelong Advertiser","football","columnists","David Schwarz"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/geelongadvertiser/images/1226976266515?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976266515","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226976266489","subtitle":"8b942022-01c5-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac","title":"Geelong Advertiser football columnists","width":100},"title":"My 2020 vision for the AFL"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":["Staff Writers"],"body":"And, more importantly, what sort of stories do you want to read and when?\n\nWe know news stories, particularly breaking news, is the staple of our digital offering.\n\nBut now, with greater accessibility through our M-site, you might be looking for something else throughout the day.\n\nSome suggestions include:\n\n- A longer read at night;\n\n- A quick wrap-up of the news at the end of day;\n\n- A regular, quirky odd spot for your afternoon break;\n\n- More breaking national and world news sprinkled throughout the day; or,\n\n- A sports feature at lunchtime.\n\nSo what sort of news are you looking for on our M-site?

It does kill people. People assume you can’t die from it but you can.”\n\nThis dedicated mother’s nightmare began three years ago when she received a phone call from her daughter asking to be picked up from a friend’s house because she was sick about 5am on a cold July morning.\n\n“She was all hunched over and could barely speak,” the distraught mother said.\n\n“When she got in the car that morning, she said: ‘Mummy I’ve used ice’.\n\n“She started vomiting. She vomited all day. Her face had actually twisted, distorted.\n\n“She lifted her little T-shirt and she said ... ‘Can you feel my chest, I think my heart is gone’.\n\n“Then I heard her yelling at someone and I went in there and she’d called the ambulance herself so she knew then it wasn’t good.”\n\nAs the paramedics wheeled her out, she said: ‘Please I just want to go to sleep now. I need to sleep’.\n\nThat was the last time this mother saw her daughter alive.\n\nThe paramedics told her to wait 30 minutes before calling the hospital.\n\nShe did as she was told and when she made the call a male staff member had to end the conversation abruptly.\n\n“I could hear her crying in the background, her little cry. He said: ‘I have to go, I have to do a procedure on your daughter’. They rang me back a couple of minutes later and said: ‘Can you come straight away, your daughter is unwell.’ That is when she would have died.\n\n“The worst part about it was that because it was drugs, and she did tell the ambos that it was ice, she was shackled to the bed. My GP told me that the word ‘shackled’ was used so many times (in the autopsy) it upset her.”\n\nIf the aftermath of her daughter’s shocking death, this mother, flooded with grief, went on a crusade to try and find the people responsible for killing her daughter.\n\nShe knocked on doors and screamed at strangers, trying to track down the ones who had sold her daughter the deadly batch. \n\n“There was an hour where apparently they (the police) can’t determine who she saw or where she was but it was obviously someone in this area that she got the drugs from,” the Geelong mother said.\n\n“I went around accusing, threatening. I was hell bent on finding out who, when, where and why but I was yelling at all the wrong people and they were missing her too.\n\n“I don’t know what I would have done if I found out anyway. I think maybe it’s just the shock of it all and you live in hope of something ... and then one day you wake up and think there is no hope.”\n\nIn the Geelong home where the pair lived, there are constant reminders of a life taken away unexpectedly.\n\nAlthough she visits her daughter in the cemetery every day, this mother has not had been able to summon the strength to pack up her things and admit that she is gone.\n\n“I still don’t shut the curtains at night in her room because when the curtains were closed I knew she was home and she was safe.\n\n“But why keep the curtains open? Why not shut them because you know she’s never going to come back. Why keep her toothbrush in the holder on the basin in the bathroom? It’s still sitting there. I haven’t moved it in three years.\n\n“I washed her dressing gown and pyjamas that she had on that day and they’re still sitting there all folded and clean for her to put back on again but she won’t.\n\n“I’d just love her back here for five minutes to tell her how much I love her.”\n\nDespite the tears that flow freely as she talks about the day that will haunt her forever, this grieving mother said she wants her experience to be a catalyst for change.\n\nShe is pleased about the Geelong alliance between police, community groups and businesses who are trying to come up with new ways to beat ice in the community.\n\nShe thinks more should be done to educate teenagers in schools, by showing them graphic images of people who have died as a result of drugs.\n\nIf she could, she would line up all the chemicals listed in her daughter’s autopsy to make young people realise what could be in the next batch.\n\nBut despite the unprecedented action taken by the community alliance, this mother is still sceptical the ice problem will ever be solved.\n\nShe saw the grip drugs had on her daughter and knows that good people can get hooked all too easily.\n\nShe said the only hope was not to get involved in the first place.\n\n“I drive through the city at night ... and I see them (the drug users) and some nights I just want to get out of the car and say it will be all right but I know that somewhere there’s going to be another mum and she’s going to go through hell,” she said.\n\n“People will often look away and think ‘why should we care, they’re nothing, nobodies’. Not true. Most of the time these are people with problems and they do care, they care a lot, and they care maybe a bit too much sometimes.”\n\nAmong the many treasured items this mother clings to to remember her daughter is a baby blue sash, like something from a beauty pageant, that her daughter had made for her before she died.\n\nShe had gone to a local florist and had them print a personal message to her hero, her mum, to be given as a Mother’s Day gift.\n\nWhen the sash was ready, this troubled girl did not have enough money to pay for it so she had to leave it at the store. \nWhen the staff found out she had died they presented one final gift to her heartbroken mother.\n\nThree years on her mother still cries when she reads the words her daughter had printed on the sash: “Happy Mother’s Day. Thank you for being my best friend.”\n\nA beautiful message from a beautiful girl who was killed by ice.\n\nGEELONG TO HOST ICE FORUM\n\nA PUBLIC forum about ice will be co-hosted by the Justice Department and Victoria Police at the Geelong Football Club from 6-8pm on July 14.\n\nThe forum will provide information about how methamphetamine substances work; the physical and psychological effects; the signs and symptoms of dependency, withdrawal and psychosis; how to engage with people who are affected by methamphetamines and treatment and support options.\n\n","byline":"NICOLE MILLS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong News and Galleries/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Top News/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-06-27T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-27T04:41:08.000Z","description":"A GEELONG mother whose daughter died alone and shackled to a hospital bed after taking one hit from a bad batch of ice has spoken out about her family’s endless grief at the hands of drugs.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/ice-kills-a-mothers-painful-goodbye/story-fnjuhovy-1226968995748?sv=13c967f17c0dfea69c3c1d590153bef0","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"8ac52f29dcf9f360cc4f58c635db9a2f","keywords":["before-and-after effects","methamphetamine substances","hospital bed","male staff member","endless grief","campaign flyer","drug manufacturers","drug users","painful goodbye","freezing cold child","people responsible","battery acid","beauty pageant","kill people","support options","curtains open","grip drugs","funeral home","young people","community alliance","final gift","community groups","Geelong Cats","Justice Department","Mike Dugdale","nail polish remover","methamphetamine drug addiction","ice addiction","County Sheriff","devastating effects","American campaign"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/ice-kills-a-mothers-painful-goodbye/story-fnjuhovy-1226968995748?sv=13c967f17c0dfea69c3c1d590153bef0","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226968995748","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"4230c1627377b0b6840115a0c475f11c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226968992450","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A GEELONG mother whose daughter died alone and shackled to a hospital bed after taking one hit from a bad batch of ice has spoken out about her family’s endless grief at the hands of drugs.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Ice kills: a mother’s painful goodbye","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Mike Dugdale"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"A mother’s painful goodbye","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"c7bc6cb0-fdb2-11e3-8a79-1c86c176d4fc - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Ice death","daughters grave","ice","death","daughters","Mike Dugdale"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/geelongadvertiser/images/1226968992394?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226968992394","originalSource":"News Limited","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226968994191","subtitle":"c7bc6cb0-fdb2-11e3-8a79-1c86c176d4fc","title":"Ice death","width":100},"title":"A mother’s painful goodbye"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"In a major coup for the Blues who are knocking on the door of a double chance, Hollmer and Steven have agreed to join the GDFL club after returning from overseas.\n\nIt’s a bitter blow for the Dolphins, who were left reeling after a mass exodus of players following its 2013 senior premiership.\n\nMany of Lorne’s stars, including Steve Oliver, Chris Giuricin, Joel Tipping and Boe Trickey, departed the CDFL club and joined former Dolphin coaches Drew Steven and Jason Langdon at Eastern Reserve.\n\nBlues coach David Mensch said, pending clearances, Hollmer and Steven would bolster the side significantly.\n\n“Tom’s a good player and Lewie’s 22-23 and he’s won a league medal in the CDFL. It’s pretty exciting for us,” Mensch said.\n\n“We’re pushing for a top-three spot and hopefully that can happen. We play five or six of the top sides now, so it’s not an easy run but if we want to be around the mark we’ll have to earn it.”\n\nInjuries have caused the Blues to restructure their side, with Mensch forced into the ruck in the absence of key talls Dan Hermans and Dan Wedding.\n\nWinchelsea has also been without its first-choice midfield group of Andrew Leak (hip flexor), Ben Davis (knee) and Kane Bonner (shin splits) for a number of weeks.\n\nOliver was also absent against Thomson on Saturday, meaning the Blues were without its key quartet of on-ballers.\n\n“We’ve had a shocking run,” Mensch said.\n\n“We were after another ruckman and Lewie is a good fit. Dan (Wedding) has been good this year but he’s had injuries and Hermans has been riddled with injuries.\n\n“It will take them (Hollmer and Steven) a few weeks to get back into it after being overseas but they give us a few options. We’ve got options galore now.”\n\nWinchelsea lodged the clearances for both Hollmer and Steven last Thursday, just days before the July 1 cut-off.\n\n“Once the clearance is lodged before July 1, it’s in the system and hopefully it can be done in the next couple of days,” Mensch said.\n\n","byline":"ALEX OATES ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Local Footy/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/","/section/geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/localfooty/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"geelongadvertiser.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T03:23:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T03:24:01.000Z","description":"INJURY-ravaged Winchelesea is set to strengthen its credentials for a top-three finish, luring Lorne premiership duo Lewie Hollmer and Tom Steven.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/localfooty/dolphins-premiership-stars-lured-into-winchelseas-net-at-eastern-reserve/story-fnjuhsge-1226975109486?sv=7f80dc4a39b5035566759772557a32b2","name":"geelongadvertiser.com.au"}],"domains":["geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"id":"8cb17eeea106457806f13161b673e30b","keywords":["double chance","first-choice midfield","pending clearances","top-three spot","top sides","bitter blow","Ben Davis","Dolphin Tom Steven","Steve Oliver","Dan Hermans","Jason Langdon","Kane Bonner","premiership duo","top-three finish","senior premiership","Blues coach","hip flexor","shin splits","Boe Trickey"],"link":"http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/localfooty/dolphins-premiership-stars-lured-into-winchelseas-net-at-eastern-reserve/story-fnjuhsge-1226975109486?sv=7f80dc4a39b5035566759772557a32b2","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975109486","originalSource":"GeelongAdvertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Sport/Local Footy/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"8b497fef12ee68e543d75fca89826962","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975106434","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"INJURY-ravaged Winchelesea has strengthened its credentials for a top-three finish, luring Lorne premiership duo Lewie Hollmer and Tom Steven.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Dolphins premiership stars lured into Winchelsea’s net at Eastern Reserve","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Dolphins stars lured into Winchelsea’s net","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"9fb2ec50-0026-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

Louis Holmer (OG) ","width":100},"title":"Dolphins stars lured into Winchelsea’s net"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"About 20 audience members had been selected to ask questions of a panel comprising Geelong mayor Darryn Lyons, G21 chief executive Elaine Carbines, Labor MP Richard Marles, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson and Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, but time constraints meant only about half of them were asked.\n\nThe most emotional questions came from audience members Michael Roach and Cathy Bond who raised the tragic death of Tamil asylum seeker Leo Seemanpillai who fatally set himself on fire in Geelong.\n\nThe rowdy 700-strong crowd was silent as they spoke about a man who was “terrified” of being returned to Sri Lanka, a country where he had been interrogated and tortured in the past, and where he feared it would happen again.\n\nMs Henderson said it was “a very dangerous exercise” to link Mr Seemanpillai’s death with federal policies and she had a surprising ally in Labor opponent Mr Marles.\n\n“He had been suffering a mental illness,” Ms Henderson said. “Suicide is a horrible, dreadful thing and so often we can’t see what is about to happen.”\n\nBut Ms Bond said government policies had played a role in his death. “He knew what being returned to Sri Lanka meant for him,” Ms Bond said. “He spoke of nothing else but his terror of being returned.”\n\nHENDERSON BLASTED IN SOCIAL MEDIA \n\nSenator Di Natale got a robust round of applause for insisting Australia’s hard line asylum seeker policy was teaching the next generation of kids to “harden their hearts and turn their back on people in need”.\n\nHe said the fact Mr Seemanpillai had donated his organs so other Australians could have a better life, demonstrated the contribution he wanted to make to this country.\n\n“We’ve just got to realise that there is never, ever a reason to lock up young kids,” he said.\n\n“We have to change what we’re doing. We can’t keep hurting people.”\n\nAnother questioner asked Cr Lyons why the city wanted to spend up to $2 million on Christmas decorations and light installations when there were people living “in their cars and under bridges”.\n\n“Wouldn’t that be better spent on helping people?” the audience member asked.\n\nBut Cr Lyons was unapologetic, saying it had been years since the city spent money on anything celebratory.\n\n“I think it is going to be a big sign of a beacon of hope,” he said. “It’s a very small price to pay to lift up our community.”\n\nBut in the end it was a surprising question from former federal Liberal candidate Mark Hoysted that received the biggest round of applause. He said he was “deeply ashamed” of the way the Liberal party was attacking people on welfare.\n\n“It is a cornerstone of the philosophy of liberalism that the strong have a duty to protect the weak,” he said in the final question of the night. “The aged, the sick and the unemployed are not economic burdens. These are people who are our fellow Australians, who need our respect and our protection.”\n\nHowever, the key theme that ran through the whole night, and the reason the show came to Geelong, was the demise of manufacturing and how Geelong would cope with large-scale job losses.\n\nAs host Tony Jones, the clear crowd favourite, said in his introduction: “It is the epicentre of manufacturing decline so what lessons can the rest of the country learn from Geelong?”\n\nThe first question of the night came from Ford worker Henry Fuller who said he was nervous about how, aged in his 50s, he was going to compete for jobs against younger workers.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about retraining but retraining to what?” he asked.\n\n“Where are the jobs going to come from?”\n\nAnother Ford worker, Anthony Anderson, asked Ms Henderson what the Abbott Government was doing, and how much they were investing, to create new jobs for retrenched manufacturing workers.\n\n“I know that I’m going to lose my job just like hundreds of others,” he said.\n\n“Where is your Government actually going to create a job, especially in this town?”\n\nMs Henderson said the Federal Government had invested $15 million into the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund and would launch a new initiative to give employers a $10,000 incentive to hire someone over 50 who has been on income support.\n\n“Manufacturing has a very, very strong future but it won’t be traditional manufacturing,” she said.\n\n“It’s sadly not going to be Alcoa, it’s not going to be making cars but in advanced manufacturing, we think there is a very, very bright future for Geelong.”\n\nMs Henderson said abolishing the carbon tax would take cost pressure off businesses and help grow the economy, in turn creating jobs.\n\nMr Marles said Geelong was facing a very difficult time economically and blamed the Abbott Government for letting the car industry die.\n\nMs Carbines said a one-stop shop was being set up at the Gordon Tafe to help manufacturing workers find job opportunities, access welfare payments or re-skill to ensure that no one was left behind.\n\nMr Di Natale said Geelong had the potential to become a hub for renewable energy.\n\n","byline":"NICOLE MILLS  ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Geelong Advertiser/Geelong News and

He can only get a gook - he can’t even get a regular girlfriend. It is so sad,” she said, as passengers groaned in offence.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan, he has got a gook.”\n\nAfter she caused a scene inside the carriage, police spoke to the woman when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney’s west.\n\n“There were police patrolling from a local area command,” police transport command assistant commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.\n\n“They were there for another matter, unaware of the full circumstances of this situation.\n\nPolice spoke to the woman but decided to let her “go about her journey”, Mr Mitchell said.\n\nMr Mitchell didn’t know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed the woman would be charged for her “abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour”.\n\n“The person responsible will be prosecuted,” he said.\n\nIf found guilty of offensive behaviour, she faces a $500 fine.\n\n“This person has committed offensive behaviour,” Mr Mitchell said.\n\n“It is a crime that we will not tolerate, particularly in regards to the racial motivation behind this incident.”\n\nThe woman told ninemsn she had a rotten day and had been scammed out of $100,000 from a man she had met on a dating website.\n\nSydney Trains chief Howard Collins said he was “shocked” by the rant and the company would be working with police to investigate.\n\n“I’m just amazed - we’ve got to stamp this out,” he said.\n\nIn April, Rebecca Blessington, 28, was charged after allegedly racially abusing two Asian women on a train from Town Hall to Bondi\n\nJade Marr boarded the train at Central Station when Ms Wilkins told her two children and two nephews, aged between four and 10, to get off the seats.\n\n“I was in shock at the time. I’m probably more angry today that someone could be that low and attack a child or anyone else.\n\n“Everyone took it seriously but it actually became quite comical, it was just ridiculous.”\n\n“We were just thinking ‘what are you doing’? It was unbelievable.\n\n“She called the police and her goal was to get my children removed from the train because they were sitting on a seat.\n\n“We don’t catch the train very often so the kids were worried they had done the wrong thing. \n\nPOLICE CHARGE WOMAN OVER RACISTS RANT \n\nRACIST RANT ON SYDNEY BUS CAUGHT ON CAMERA \n\nTAMARAMA SURF VICTIM WAS FATHER OF TWO \n\nTHREE CHARGED OVER CROWN WITNESS KILLING \n\n“They were frightened that the police were coming to get them. I just kept telling them that they hadn’t done anything wrong and that this woman was not responding the way that normal people do.\n\n“My nephew was really concerned about the words she was using and the way she spoke to the other woman.\n\n“The kids just didn’t understand why someone would say that.”\n\nMs Wilkins was in apologetic mood this afternoon.\n\n“I had a rotten day,’ she told Ninemsn . ‘I’ve been chasing work for quite some time now,” she said.\n\n“It’s awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,” Ms Wilkins said.\n\nWilkins became enraged at some young children after they did not give into her demands for a seat on a morning Central Coast train.\n\nShe then started abusing passengers including an Asian woman and a man who stood up for her.\n\n“Who is this little jerk off he can only get a gook, he can’t even get a regular girlfriend — it is so sad,” she said.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan he has got a gook — look at it. She probably thinks he is rich.”\n\nThe video was posted onto YouTube by user Kareem Abdul.\n\n“On the Central coast & Newcastle line in peak hour during school holidays,” Abdul wrote.\n\n“I started filming as the woman became aggressive toward some children (ages 12 and under) who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded.\n\n“This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids.\n\n“The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her and now the lady is calling the police … Because the kids didn’t move?”\n\n","byline":"Ben Pike and Ian Walker

offensive language and issued a field court attendance notice to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on May 9.\n\nNursing a young child in her arms, she allegedly yelled and threatened at least five women on a busy morning train between Town Hall and Bondi Junction.\n\nThe footage, allegedly filmed at about 8.30am on Tuesday April 8, shows a woman bouncing her toddler on her knee as she taunts other commuters.\n\nOne commuter filmed the entire outburst where the woman said to another passenger: “I’ll ****** hurt ya … So don’t underestimate me, ****.”\n\nThe woman said she was of Aboriginal descent before abusing two Asian women riding in the carriage.\n\n“Youse aren’t citizens. You come in here and take our country ya *****. You know it too. And guess what mate — there’s a war comin’. A war between us and youse.”\n\n“You know the ones that were here first? The black fellas, the Kooris, which I am. This is our country mate.”\n\nOne passenger stood up to the woman and warned that her threats were being taken seriously.\n\nBlessington shouted in reply: “I do not care … You’re all scum!”\n\nAnother passenger pressed the train’s emergency button to alert security.\n\nThe footage was handed to the Police Transport Command and officers visited Blessington’s home at Merrylands West this morning.\n\nInquiries into the incident are continuing and police are urging anyone who witnessed it, or similar behaviour, to contact investigators.\n\n","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Network

There is a 15 year age gap between the pair.\n\nDe Rossi, who starred in Ally McBeal, has previously spoken openly of her struggles with an eating disorder.\n\nIn her candid memoir written in 2010, which detailed her struggles with bulimia, de Rossi said “I swallowed my disillusionment in the form of cream sauces, pina coladas and pastries”.\n\n","byline":"CHRISTINE SAMS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/couriermail.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/perthnow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T10:39:04.000Z","description":"It is the secret rehab stint which has the showbiz world speculating about the state of Portia de Rossi’s marriage to Ellen DeGeneres.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fni0cvc9-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2s-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2p-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2r-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2q-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"838d80168657be0e2c77e8427f7c27c0","keywords":["rehab facility","rehab visit","New York","United States of America","Croatia","US magazine","Ellen DeGeneres","alcohol issues","drug issues","secret rehab stint","high-profile female spouses","age gap","rehab dealing","Portia de Rossi"],"kicker":"Hollywood hell","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2p-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975641028","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"a0c7ec8ed4ddefe490e4114ccc0b23bb","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975640974","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"IT is the secret rehab stint which has the showbiz world speculating about the state of Portia de Rossi’s marriage to Ellen DeGeneres.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Rumours fly that marriage woes with Ellen DeGeneres led to Portia de Rossi’s rehab stint","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Marriage woes led to Portia’s rehab stint","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8e57cbce-01c0-11e4-aaf7-dc6e5517e581 -

Some later editions also contained Tickets of Leave, Pardons or Certificates of Freedom as well as details of any further crimes a convict committed in the colony.\n\nThey give a fascinating insight into the pre-photography appearances of the times and show the astonishing prevalence of body art.\n\nIn fact in 1831, of the 3000 convicts transported to New South Wales about 30 per cent of the men and 10 per cent of the women were recorded as having some form of inking 1.\n\nAnother mystery of the heart found in these records is the case of Thomas Hicken. A 21-year-old farm hand from Cheshire, Thomas was convicted to life transportation to NSW for the crime of sheep stealing in 1834.\n\nThomas is described in the Convict Indents as 5’10” with brown eyes and brown hair and the following tattoos: a man, “when this you see, remember me and bear me in your mind” on torso; a man and woman, flowerpot, two birds, “true love” on lower right arm, man standing on an anchor, fish, on upper left arm; bird on a branch, 1831, woman and basket, on lower left arm; anchor back of left hand, blue ring on fourth finger of same, scar outside left leg.\n\nIt seems that Thomas had a sweetheart who he’d left behind in England, however his marital status is listed in is indent as “single”. Was his de facto sweetheart the woman with a basket tattooed onto his left arm? Did they meet in 1831?\n\nNot much else is known about Thomas, and he doesn’t appear in any records for the next 64 years. As was common in those days, family members in England who were looking for relatives abroad placed advertisements in newspapers or police gazettes in an attempt to find information about them.\n\nIt seems that someone with the same last name as Thomas, from his home town of Cheshire, was looking for him and placed a Missing Friends ad in an 1898 NSW Police Gazette: “Inquiry requested as to the whereabouts of Thomas Hicken or Higgin. Arrived in this Colony by the ship “Henry Porcher” in 1835.\n\nDescription on arrival: 21 years of age, 5’10”, sallow complexion, pockpitted, brown hair brown eyes; single; a farm servant; a native of Cheshire. Inquiries at the instance of William Thomas Hicken, 17 Regent St, Moulton, near Northwick, Cheshire”.\n\nIf still alive, Thomas would have been 84 by the time this advertisement was posted. Was this man looking for him possibly his illegitimate son, named after him by a lonely sweetheart left behind in England?\n\nInterestingly, the tattoos listed in the indents often held different meanings in the 19th century, with popular tattoos such as an anchor not symbolising a career as a mariner but rather symbolising one’s faith or hope.\n\nSome convicts, like 13-year-old William Robinson had only one or two tattoos: “five dots lower left arm, H back of left wrist”, with others such as 27-year-old William Martin adorned with strings of letters: “ ‘MBAMAGJMJMWNTM’ on right arm, ‘woman’, ‘WBABSBJBMNDM’ and ‘TM’ on left arm, ring on left third finger”.\n\nSmall groups of letters have been interpreted as possible initials of a loved one, with larger groups of letters maybe referring to a biblical phrase or political slogan of which the meaning is now lost.\n\nLooking at the records, it appears the five dots are a consistent form of convict tattoo, among both men and women. Although we don’t have a definitive understanding for what these dots mean, Tasmanian professor and convict expert, Hamish Maxwell-Stewart, has a theory: “the five dots tattoo which persisted into the 1870s probably means ‘I have been inside’.\n\nThe four outer dots are thought to represent the corners of the cell and the central one the prisoner.”\n\nAlthough we may not know what they meant, we do know that the edgy tattooed hipsters of today are simply following a trend as old as the colonies.\n\n","byline":"Staff writes ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Top News/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T03:36:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T03:36:25.000Z","description":"ELIZABETH Brazier was 26 when she was convicted of highway robbery in London in 1838 and sentenced to 15 years’ transportation to NSW.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pierced-hearts-anchors-and-flower-pots-the-history-of-convict-tattoos/story-fni0cx4q-1226976286398?sv=ff805ed9ca82d208fdcdb9769f189846","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au"],"id":"78a1c19ae4e046b48bacf5b2abac95de","keywords":["family history","online family","family history resource","family history records","online family history","online family resource","family story","family trees","historical records","family relative","key dates","genealogical records","right arm","body art","convict tattoos","National Library","anchor tatt","shipped convicts","cryptic collections","biblical passages","brown eyes","brown hair","blue ring","body tatts","edgy tattooed hipsters","life transportation","Convict body art","dots tattoo","basket tattooed","home town","Vintage body art","ship records show","William Thomas","farm hand","police gazettes","description column","family members","hair brown eyes","England","New South Wales","Australia","London","United Kingdom","Dubbo","University of Tasmania","William Stevens","Hamish Maxwell-Stewart","William \"Smokey\" Robinson","Jr.","William Martin","Matthew Newton","William Thomas Hicken"],"kicker":"Vintage body art","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pierced-hearts-anchors-and-flower-pots-the-history-of-convict-tattoos/story-fni0cx4q-1226976286398?sv=ff805ed9ca82d208fdcdb9769f189846","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976286398","originalAssetId":"1226976286398","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"5fc9dd4e9ea66ed9af3e1511a9542445","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976327571","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"OUR early convicts loved the sort of body art you would expect to see on modern day celebrities.

assault on four girls from 1968 to 1986, lawyers in Australia and the UK are considering­ taking legal action to freeze his assets to stop him disposing of them ahead of any civil claims.\n\nThe moves follow his trial in London being told of an email written by his daughter Bindi in July 2012 in which she said she expected to be his sole heir and likened the windfall to winning the lottery.\n\nWhile Harris, 84, and his wife Alwen jointly own a $9 million mansion in millionaires’ row in Bray, southern England, the bulk of his wealth from his 60-year career is held by two companies set up on the same day in January 2012.\n\nRHEL Holdings Ltd controls Rolf Harris Enterprises Ltd, which was established back in 1963 and has been run by his Sydney-based brother Bruce Harris, 90.\n\nRecords filed in the UK last year reveal the company had more than $2 million in cash, $4,640,000 in assets, and liabilities of $872,000.\n\nRHS Investments, a family trust set up to minimise tax, has a net worth of $12,700,000 and cash in the bank of $3 million, records state.\n\nThe new companies were set up nine months before Scotland Yard launched Operation Yewtree, which originally investigated the sexual depravities of well-known British entertainer Jimmy Savile but was later expanded to inquire into other alleged sex offenders, including Harris.\n\nLaw firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing more than 170 of Savile’s victims through its UK office, has been contacted by a number of women in both the UK and Australia who claim they were abused by Harris.\n\nA High Court claim could be launched in the UK within weeks. Melbourne-based Sla-ter and Gordon senior public liability partner Barrie Woollacott yesterday said they were encouraging the women to contact police and were investigating their claims as they considered seeking orders freezing Harris’s assets.\n\nHe said while Rolf Harris Enterprises was registered in Australia, it may have no ­assets here: “In order to ensure that that wealth remains available for the victims rather than being locked up in trusts or transferred, it’s important proceedings commence quickly so a freeze on those assets can be ordered by the court.’’\n\nNSW Police were not investigating allegations against Harris because they had not received any complaints, a spokesman said.\n\n","byline":"JANET FIFE-YEOMANS

He has been regarded as the best in the game for a long time and has a mortgage on the Australian jumper and is captain of the country.\n\nBRISBANE BEWARE, BLUE CREW IS COMING \n\nPRESSURE OFF AS BLUES EYE THREE-PEAT \n\n“For me it’s about proving myself every time I play against him.\n\n“I’d like to think that not only this year but every time I’ve come up against him at club or at this (Origin) level, I’ve shown that he is not better than me.\n\n“I still believe that. It doesn’t change if we’ve won or not. That’s my mindset, whether it’s him or anyone else.\n\n“One thing he has been praised for is his calmness and consistency and it’s something I continue to work on. I believe in what I do and the way I prepare and play.”\n\nFarah said he has been in career-best form recently in a sixth-placed Tigers team that was tipped to struggle this season.\n\n“You don’t like hearing that [Smith is better],” Farah said.\n\n“It has taken me a while to get back in this (Origin) arena. I was out of it for a couple of years.\n\n“I think the last couple of years I’ve played the best footy I’ve played in my career. Definitely the most consistent footy.\n\n“That’s something I was criticised for in the past — my flair and the options I took. I like to think my consistency has improved.”\n\nFarah does concede though he will struggle to oust Smith as Kangaroos hooker.\n\nCHAMBERS ASSAULT CLAIM ROCKS MAROONS \n\nAsked was there anything he could do to become Australia’s starting hooker, Farah said: “Probably not. Unless he gets an injury and I wouldn’t wish that upon him.\n\n“It’s always pretty hard going into the Aussie camp knowing you are playing second fiddle waiting for your time. I never quite feel part of the side even though you are in the squad.\n\n“That’s the way it is, that is something you have to deal with. I am lucky to have played for Australia. Some guys never get the chance and I am grateful for the chance I had but I am also realistic and know where I stand and I am fine with that.\n\n“Some people didn’t even think I should have been in the last squad. Some d**khead journalist in Queensland — I’d love to see him for a couple of minutes on a footy field.”\n\nNSW back-rower Ryan Hoffman spoke glowingly about Farah and Smith.\n\n“Cam is the best player I have ever played with,” Hoffman said.\n\n“I have been lucky enough to play with him for 13 years.

All it took was the right guidance, the right people, the right opportunities. And one heck of a first serve.\n\nNick Kyrgios grew up in Canberra to Greek dad George and Malaysian mum Norlaila — a talented badminton player.\n\nHe spent weekends playing ball boy to his tennis-loving brother Christos, eight years his senior, before picking up a racquet of his own.\n\nOnly then was he able to demonstrate an uncanny knack for hitting a ball where the other player wasn’t, and lightning hand-eye co-ordination that made up for his early lack of agility.\n\nBrent Larkham, head coach of the Australian Institute of Sport’s men’s tennis program, coached Kyrgios for two years until 2013 and followed his progress long before that.\n\n“He has always had that fearless approach that he showed against Nadal,” Larkham said yesterday.\n\n“He hits the ball big off both sides and he serves and returns extremely well, so it’s no surprise he’s done so well. It’s just a bit surprising that it happened so quickly.”\n\nLarkham admitted his former student’s movement was “never really that good”, but improved once he entered the AIS and focused on fitness.\n\n“When he came to the AIS program he had more physiotherapy and a lot more access to the gym and that really helped him,” he said.\n\n“But he has always had this incredible self-belief — he’s had that from day one. He’s not scared of any occasion. It has always been the bigger the match, the bigger he plays, and that is a hard thing to teach.”\n\nSuch confidence can translate to cockiness, but other mentors of Kyrgios said his feet were firmly on the ground.\n\nTracey Lea, a pastoral care adviser at Daramalan College, where Kyrgios completed his HSC, said Kyrgios was “a very bright boy”, popular with students and respected by teachers: “He is a really nice guy — friendly, funny and was always very physically engaged.\n\n“He didn’t ask for special treatment but I think all his peers recognised there was something pretty extraordinary about him.”\n\nMrs Lea said the loss of an uncle in a motorcycle accident while Kyrgios was in Year 11 “taught him about resilience and taught him that things can hurt you”.\n\n“He’s not all just exuberance, confidence and bravado — there is a really decent young man there, and a kind and intelligent boy as well,” she said.\n\nSuch qualities make him the perfect target for sponsorship and endorsement opportunities, according to Central Queensland University sports management expert Dr Danya Hodgetts.\n\nShe said Kyrgios’s success at Wimbledon could translate to deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, rising to millions if he keeps winning the big games.\n\n“The aim now is to capitalise on that success and leverage it as soon as possible to get sponsorships,” she said.\n\n“Certainly, he’ll get a good burst for the next 12 or 24 months, depending on what contracts he signs, and then it is really up to him being able to continue to succeed on-court and build his brand.”\n\nCHAMPIONS win big matches for a multitude of good reasons.\n\nSticking it to mum isn’t usually one of them.\n\nThat, however, is ­apparently what drove Nick Kyrgios to outclass the world’s No.1 early yesterday morning while most of Australia slept.\n\n“I saw in an interview that my mum thought Rafa was too good for me,” the towering 19-year-old said in a post-match interview at Wimbledon.\n\n“So that made me a little angry.”\n\nHe vowed to send an SMS smiley face to his mother, Norlaila, in response to her comment.\n\nDespite the excitement of her son’s famous win, mum was still simply calling just like she saw it yesterday.\n\nSpeaking to 3AW, Mrs Kyrgios wasn’t getting too excited about her son’s chances in his quarter-final match against Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\n“If he’s serving well he can get it,” she said.\n\n“But if he’s not serving well, then no.”\n\nAnd she had some motherly gems of advice for her youngest boy, who has rocketed from relative obscurity to the top echelon of his sport in just 18 months.\n\n“You just have to treat people nice, be nice to everybody, show them respect,” she said.\n\nJust goes to show: Mums aren’t always right ... but they usually are.\n\n","byline":"neil keene ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and

I’m just going to reflect on that the next couple days.”\n\nScheduled to contest Newport next week, the Canberran rises to a career-high mark of world No 66 and banks a prizemoney cheque of $432,000, almost doubling his career haul.\n\nBut Raonic, the first Canadian male to reach the semi-finals here, was a bridge too far.\n\nThe world No 9 was relieved and elated to have staved off Kyrgios.\n\n“It hasn’t really sunk in,” he said post-match.\n\n“To have that kind of win is pretty special.\n\n“It’s another step forward, the goal is to be the No 1 player in the world and this is another step towards that goal.”\n\nAttempting to become the first Wimbledon debutant to reach the semi-finals since David Nalbandian in 2002, Kyrgios lacked zip in the first set against Raonic.\n\nBut he showed plenty of class and resilience by winning, despite the Canadian having more — and better — opportunities.\n\nA framed forehand in the tiebreak rewarded Kyrgios’s doggedness but it became obvious he was running on fumes.\n\nBroken twice in the second set to allow Raonic to draw level, Kyrgios bounced back in the third set to claim an immediate break before leading 2-0.\n\nA few minutes later, he was back on the ropes as Raonic rolled through five successive games.\n\nKyrgios’s fatigue was illustrated in the botched smash he dumped into the net as Raonic maintained focus and intensity to keep the young Australian at bay.\n\n“I think it (the Nadal match) had a pretty big impact,” he said.\n\n“I was struggling physically about halfway through the second set. I was feeling sore in a couple places.\n\n“But I’m not going to take any credit away from him (Raonic) He served unbelievable.\n\n“I thought I came out strong on his first return game. I made him earn that.\n\n“All the other service games it looked like he was in such a rhythm that I just couldn’t do anything out there.”\n\nThe lanky right-hander methodically secured the third set, leaving Kyrgios with a huge task to reach the last four.\n\nKyrgios battled valiantly, regrouping to force a tiebreak.\n\nBut once there, he faltered leaving Raonic to cruise 6-1. There would be one final twist as Kyrgios saved three match points before Raonic hammered home a clinching ace.\n\nKyrgios bowed out to the acclaim of Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n“He’s a pretty exciting player to watch,” Dimitrov said. “Obviously he’s got a lot of skills and talent.”\n\nDjokovic was similarly generous.\n\n“Kyrgios just got into the mix in this tournament. He’s a 19-yearold, which is amazing.\n\n“It’s good for tennis to see that, because we lacked a little bit of successful teenagers in the last 10 years or so.\n\n“So we have these youngsters coming up, fearless on the court, hitting the ball, you know, not caring who is across the net.\n\n“It’s good. You know, it gets more attention to new faces and to new wave of generation that is able to challenge the best and be contending for grand slam titles.”\n\nKrygios stamped himself as a future champion with wins over Stephane Robert, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Vesely and Nadal.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

III, backing Chambers to mentally cope with what he says is the biggest test of the Queensland debutant’s career.\n\nThe Queensland camp is rallying around Chambers, who is under police investigation over the alleged assault of a patron at Brisbane’s Down Under Bar yesterday morning.\n\nThe Blues are watching the Chambers saga with interest, motivated by Meninga questioning NSW’s culture after halfback Mitchell Pearce was axed over a nightclub incident in the lead-up to Origin I.\n\nHIT UP: MAROONS PREPARED TO FAIL \n\nALLEGED SCUFFLE TARNISHES WILL’S DEBUT \n\nCHAMBERS DRAMA ‘STORM IN A TEACUP’: COYNE \n\nWhen asked in NSW camp today whether Meninga has egg on his face over that sentiment in light of the Chambers fallout, Bird didn’t hold back.\n\n“I guess he probably does,” the NSW hardman said.\n\n“NSW boys have been in their share of strife over the last couple of years .... off-field dramas.\n\n“It’s nice to be tucked away in Coffs Harbour and not be a part of it.\n\n“But it’s the nature of today’s society that the smallest thing is going to be exaggerated and everything from the past brought up.\n\n“But I am sure it’s a storm in a teacup and glamourised for the media.”\n\nBird said the arrest of Blake Ferguson last year before game two in Brisbane for indecent assault was a distraction and said Queensland would experience a similar problem this week.\n\n“I know our situation last year going into game two without ‘Fergo’ it did create quite a distraction to start the camp,” he said.\n\n“You don’t want to talk about it or dwell on it, you just want to focus on football. You don’t need these dramas.”\n\nNo charges have yet been laid and Chambers will formally make his Origin debut this Wednesday night if Queensland police choose not to take action against the Maroons rookie.\n\nMyles said Maroons players are supporting Chambers but concedes the 26-year-old is facing the ultimate test of character if cleared to play at Suncorp Stadium.\n\n“I’ll throw it out there, this is another test for the man,” he said.\n\n“If it wasn’t enough getting ready for his first (Origin) game, now it’s a test of getting ready with another thing over him.\n\n“But Will is a great bloke and his footy has been doing enough to get him in the side. I know he will be alright, he just has to train hard and play better on the night.\n\n“It’s not the first time we’ve had distractions in camp, as a team we need to keep doing what we are doing.\n\n“None of the boys have been affected by it, to be honest we haven’t even spoken about it.\n\n“We’ll see how it pans out but I think he’ll be fine.”\n\nMyles, who was sacked by the Roosters in 2011 for breaching an alcohol ban, said some NRL players have stopped going out to avoid being a public target.\n\n“I know a lot of blokes who are already on that bandwagon, they just play it safe and cross out the uncontrollables and do it that way,” he said.\n\n“To their credit it works a bit better for them.\n\n“There’s no excuses in this ... but for sure, there’s no doubt that sometimes people as an incentive will target someone (an NRL player).\n\n“There is so much of a view and criticism of footy players and how they should act, but it goes both ways, there are people out there who can be as silly as footballers.\n\n“Footy players aren’t the only ones who can act silly. It goes both ways and unfortunately it happens and you have to be careful with it.”\n\n","byline":"Peter Badel ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/State of Origin -

2pm.\n\nPolice suspect he was washed up shore and was found on rocks at Tamarama.\n\nHachette UK group chief executive officer Tim Hely Hutchinson confirmed Mr Richell’s death.\n\n“With great sorrow, and in shock, we have to announce the death of our beloved friend and colleague, Matt Richell, CEO of Hachette Australia and Chairman of Hachette New Zealand, who was tragically killed in a surfing accident today,” he said.\n\n“Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with Matt’s wife Hannah, his family, his colleagues and many friends in publishing and more widely.”\n\nMr Richell and his wife Hannah are from Britain and were living in Balmain in Sydney’s inner west with their children aged six and three.\n\nParamedics performed CPR for an extended period of time before an ambulance helicopter arrived but sometime after he was declared dead.\n\n“He suffered a head injury... it looks like a possible drowning.\n\n“It was not treated as suspicious,” police said.\n\nInvestigations are continuing and a report will be prepared for the coroner.\n\nA surfer said he saw people screaming down to the water pointing at a man who needed help.\n\n“I looked at him and he was already

waving his hands in the air and then got pushed around by the current into the rocks.\n\n","byline":"Sarah Crawford, Ben Pike, Tanya Smart and Shae McDonald

the test of time to clock up its 6000th episode tonight at 7pm Channel 7).\n\nTo celebrate, here are the 10 biggest stars to come out of the show:\n\nGuy Pearce may be one of Australia’s biggest stars, who’s been in everything from The Hurt Locker to Memento, but he was killed off after six weeks on Home and Away.\n\nHe played David Croft — A failed investor who arrived in Summer Bay in 1991 to patch things up with his sister, but ended up getting a crush on a younger woman.\n\nWhile listening to a mix tape from his new love interest, he is hit by a car and is killed instantly. The distraught object of his affections then realises she’s carrying his baby.\n\nPearce’s impressive CV includes roles in Academy Award winning The Hurt Locker, Iron Man 3 and Prometheus.\n\nTeenage runaway Angel Brooks may be remembered for her strong eyebrows, but if you browse the character’s history, you’ll see the plucky character played by Melissa George was no lightweight.\n\nShe became temporarily paralysed after a car crash, survived a seaplane crash, supported her baby as he was diagnosed with leukaemia, loses her husband to septicaemia and gave birth to her second child in a storm that cuts off all roads to the hospital.\n\nIt’s eyebrow-raising stuff to say the least.\n\nGeorge has gone on to appear in several US TV series including Alias, as well as the acclaimed Australian drama The Slap, and films ranging from Mulholland Drive to The Amityville Horror remake.\n\nBefore Australian acting great Heath Ledger played Batman bad boy The Joker, he was the resident rebel in Summer Bay.\n\nNot only did he score a night in the back of a van with Sally Fletcher, he then tried to set her up for stealing the headmaster’s favourite record.\n\nThe prank, however was the beginning of the end as he was expelled from the school, and the series, soon after.\n\nLedger went on to deliver criticially acclaimed performances in Aussie films Two Hands and Candy and international blockbusters from Brokeback Mountain to The Dark Knight.\n\nHe tragically passed away in 2008, aged 28.\n\nThe fiery redhead arrives in Summer Bay as a foster child in 1994 along with her brother Curtis, but she is soon caught kissing him and it is revealed they’re not blood relatives.\n\nAfter dating a drug dealer, she moves on to Angel’s husband, making a move on him while she’s supposed to be babysitting their child.\n\nShe then has a lesbian flirtation with an author that she scares away by writing a romantic short story about the two of them, however they reunite later and leave for Paris as a duo.\n\nPost Summer Bay, Fisher has carved a niche in quirky comic film roles from The Wedding Crashers to Confessions of a Shopaholic, although recently proved she can still take a dramatic turn in The Great Gatsby. She is married to actor comedian Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nLong before Thor, Chris Hemsworth played the headmaster’s son Kim Hyde.\n\nIn his stint on the show from 2004 to 2007, he spent a fair amount of screen time with his shirt off — rescuing friends from the surf, joining swim squads, working out at the gym and having romantic trysts with girlfriends — including one steamy scene that followed a helicopter crash.\n\nHe also overdosed on ecstasy, was accused of sexual assault and ended up in a love triangle that saw him leaving his wife to be with his ex girlfriend.\n\nWhere is he now? Cutting a swathe through Hollywood in a string of leading man roles from Snow White and the Huntsman to The Avengers and of course, Thor.\n\nAs a wheelchair-bound love interest Julie Gibson, Naomi Watts had a short stint on Home and Away.\n\nIn one month, she had a romance thwarted by her overbearing brother Revhead, lost her father to a heart attack and left the Bay to study at university.\n\nNow one of Hollywood’s leading dramatic actresses, Watts has starred everything from Tank Girl to King Kong and The Impossible.\n\nThe Americans know him as the sexy-but-stupid vampire hater on True Blood but for us Aussies, Ryan Kwanten will always be Vinnie Patterson.\n\nThe character arrived in Summer Bay on a jet ski in 1997 and broke a fair few hearts during his five-year stint including long-time character Sally Fletcher. He was a burger flipper by day and a stripper by night, but he got fired from his day job after wearing his burger apron to a stripping job.\n\nAfter getting a full-body sunburn at a nudist beach, Sally applies lotion on his sensitive areas and discovers a lump. It turns out to be testicular cancer and he has surgery to have it removed.\n\nHe ends up in prison on fraud charges, and while Summer Bay things he died in a prison fire, he actually survived and was living in witness protection, where he dies, for real, in a farming accident.\n\nWhile Kwanten has a huge fan base internationally thanks to True Blood, he has also starred in several films including Red Hill.\n\nShe may have played a super-attractive alien robot in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen but her Home and Away role was as a shy wildling.\n\nHer character Tasha Andrews appears on the beach in 2003 confused and disoriented, speaking only Latin. It is revealed she was raised by wacky survivalists and is reintegrated into society by way of the good folk at Summer Bay.\n\nShe finds love, gets married joins a cult and eventually, moves to Boston.\n\nWhile most Australians choose a soapie, the Minogues most probably have VCRs of Home and Away and Neighbours. While Kylie was strutting around on Ramsay St, Dannii was living it up in Summer Bay.\n\nMinogue played tomboy Emma Jackson, who was always getting into trouble sneaking alcohol, slamming doors and being an all-round spunky punk.\n\nBut the bad girl has a tragic back story of abuse at her stepfather’s hands after her father died, but grows up to reconcile with her mother. She leaves after about a year to become an air hostess on the Gold Coast.\n\nMinogue’s post-soapie story has included stints as a pop star, TV presenter and judge on programs from Uk and Ireland’s Top Model to The X Factor.\n\nHollywood success story Simon Baker may be at ease cast alongside the likes of Anne Hathaway and Kevin Spacey but on Home and Away, he played a bit part.\n\nIn 1993 to 1994, Baker played James Healey but he’s also had roles on Heartbreak High and E Street.\n\nBaker is now best known for his role as the star of US Tv series The Mentalist.\n\n","byline":"Cayla Dengate and Bryn Kay ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NewsLocal/All Local News and Photos/Nth Beaches news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-03T05:05:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T05:05:49.000Z","description":"From Naomi Watts to Isla Fisher, some big names have come out of Home and Away.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/top-10-aussie-stars-who-made-their-name-on-home-and-away/story-fngr8hax-1226976127330?sv=b7d04e7cf62ae8d471dd2821afa4404d","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au"],"id":"bc02397378c60032b2ea6408e26ddca2","keywords":["Naomi Watts","Guy Pearce","Heath Ledger","Julie Gibson","Vinnie Patterson","Melissa George","Dannii Minogue","Chris Hemsworth","Ryan Kwanten","Isla Fisher","Tasha Andrews","Simon Baker","Isabel Lucas","love interest","wheelchair-bound love interest","super-attractive alien robot","long-time character","plucky character","overbearing brother","helicopter crash","Hollywood success story","air hostess","five-year stint","prison fire","Gold Coast","Queensland","Australia","Hollywood","California","United States of America","Boston","Massachusetts","Paris","France","David Croft","Emma Jackson","Kim Hyde","James Healey","Anne Jacqueline Hathaway","Sally Fletcher","sexy-but-stupid vampire hater","testicular cancer","fiery redhead","Australian acting","foster child","steamy scene","Kevin Spacey","wacky survivalists","tragic back story","sensitive areas","failed investor","burger flipper","heart attack","nudist beach","lesbian flirtation","witness protection","favourite record","love triangle","fraud charges"],"kicker":"Star power","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/top-10-aussie-stars-who-made-their-name-on-home-and-away/story-fngr8hax-1226976127330?sv=b7d04e7cf62ae8d471dd2821afa4404d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976127330","originalAssetId":"1226976127330","originalSource":"Manly Daily","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NewsLocal/All Local News and Photos/Nth Beaches news/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"cf13fc5033f647f6654f92a6e83ad79b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976122815","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"Home and Away marks its 6000th episode tonight, and  to celebrate, we take a look at the top 10 biggest Aussie exports who made their names in Summer Bay.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Top 10 Aussie stars who made their name on Home and Away ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Soapie to stardom: Our top 10 Home and Away exports","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6e2dd9de-0250-11e4-a373-8ada4e17eafa - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["tag"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/dailytelegraph/images/1226976623816?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976623816","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226976623445","subtitle":"6e2dd9de-0250-11e4-a373-8ada4e17eafa","title":"Soapie to stardom: Our top 10 Home and Away exports","width":100},"title":"Soapie to stardom: Our top 10 Home and Away exports"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"The wife of Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke joined the panel in selecting models, wearing swimwear, for the Spring/Summer David Jones launch later this month.\n\nShe told Confidential at the Docklands: “It wasn’t that long ago that I was on the other side of the fence, walking and being judged.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for emerging models to walk alongside Jessica Gomes and Montana Cox.\n\n“I look for healthy models, a person full of energy and individuality and we’re such a multicultural society.

The woman became angry at two young children when they didn’t give their seats up for her.\n\nShe then began to abuse other passengers, including a man who was sitting next to an Asian woman. “Who is this little jerk-off? He can only get a gook - he can’t even get a regular girlfriend. It is so sad,” she said, as passengers groaned in offence.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan, he has got a gook.”\n\nAfter she caused a scene inside the carriage, police spoke to the woman when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney’s west.\n\n“There were police patrolling from a local area command,” police transport command assistant commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.\n\n“They were there for another matter, unaware of the full circumstances of this situation.\n\nPolice spoke to the woman but decided to let her “go about her journey”, Mr Mitchell said.\n\nMr Mitchell didn’t know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed the woman would be charged for her “abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour”.\n\n“The person responsible will be prosecuted,” he said.\n\nIf found guilty of offensive behaviour, she faces a $500 fine.\n\n“This person has committed offensive behaviour,” Mr Mitchell said.\n\n“It is a crime that we will not tolerate, particularly in regards to the racial motivation behind this incident.”\n\nThe woman told ninemsn she had a rotten day and had been scammed out of $100,000 from a man she had met on a dating website.\n\nSydney Trains chief Howard Collins said he was “shocked” by the rant and the company would be working with police to investigate.\n\n“I’m just amazed - we’ve got to stamp this out,” he said.\n\nIn April, Rebecca Blessington, 28, was charged after allegedly racially abusing two Asian women on a train from Town Hall to Bondi\n\nJade Marr boarded the train at Central Station when Ms Wilkins told her two children and two nephews, aged between four and 10, to get off the seats.\n\n“I was in shock at the time. I’m probably more angry today that someone could be that low and attack a child or anyone else.\n\n“Everyone took it seriously but it actually became quite comical, it was just ridiculous.”\n\n“We were just thinking ‘what are you doing’? It was unbelievable.\n\n“She called the police and her goal was to get my children removed from the train because they were sitting on a seat.\n\n“We don’t catch the train very often so the kids were worried they had done the wrong thing. \n\nPOLICE CHARGE WOMAN OVER RACISTS RANT \n\nRACIST RANT ON SYDNEY BUS CAUGHT ON CAMERA \n\nTAMARAMA SURF VICTIM WAS FATHER OF TWO \n\nTHREE CHARGED OVER CROWN WITNESS KILLING \n\n“They were frightened that the police were coming to get them. I just kept telling them that they hadn’t done anything wrong and that this woman was not responding the way that normal people do.\n\n“My nephew was really concerned about the words she was using and the way she spoke to the other woman.\n\n“The kids just didn’t understand why someone would say that.”\n\nMs Wilkins was in apologetic mood this afternoon.\n\n“I had a rotten day,’ she told Ninemsn . ‘I’ve been chasing work for quite some time now,” she said.\n\n“It’s awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,” Ms Wilkins said.\n\nWilkins became enraged at some young children after they did not give into her demands for a seat on a morning Central Coast train.\n\nShe then started abusing passengers including an Asian woman and a man who stood up for her.\n\n“Who is this little jerk off he can only get a gook, he can’t even get a regular girlfriend — it is so sad,” she said.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan he has got a gook — look at it. She probably thinks he is rich.”\n\nThe video was posted onto YouTube by user Kareem Abdul.\n\n“On the Central coast & Newcastle line in peak hour during school holidays,” Abdul wrote.\n\n“I started filming as the woman became aggressive toward some children (ages 12 and under) who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded.\n\n“This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids.\n\n“The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her and now the lady is calling the police … Because the kids didn’t move?”\n\n","byline":"Ben Pike and Ian Walker

There is a 15 year age gap between the pair.\n\nDe Rossi, who starred in Ally McBeal, has previously spoken openly of her struggles with an eating disorder.\n\nIn her candid memoir written in 2010, which detailed her struggles with bulimia, de Rossi said “I swallowed my disillusionment in the form of cream sauces, pina coladas and pastries”.\n\n","byline":"CHRISTINE SAMS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/couriermail.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/display/perthnow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T10:39:04.000Z","description":"It is the secret rehab stint which has the showbiz world speculating about the state of Portia de Rossi’s marriage to Ellen DeGeneres.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fni0cvc9-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2s-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2p-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2r-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2q-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"838d80168657be0e2c77e8427f7c27c0","keywords":["rehab facility","rehab visit","New York","United States of America","Croatia","US magazine","Ellen DeGeneres","alcohol issues","drug issues","secret rehab stint","high-profile female spouses","age gap","rehab dealing","Portia de Rossi"],"kicker":"Hollywood hell","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/confidential/rumours-fly-that-marriage-woes-with-ellen-degeneres-led-to-portia-de-rossis-rehab-stint/story-fnilxh2p-1226975641028?sv=eb72cf9c518a0682788ea9c1f0b958dd","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975641028","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Sydney Confidential/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"a0c7ec8ed4ddefe490e4114ccc0b23bb","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975640974","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"IT is the secret rehab stint which has the showbiz world speculating about the state of Portia de Rossi’s marriage to Ellen DeGeneres.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Rumours fly that marriage woes with Ellen DeGeneres led to Portia de Rossi’s rehab stint","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Marriage woes led to Portia’s rehab stint","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8e57cbce-01c0-11e4-aaf7-dc6e5517e581 -

Melbourne-based Sla-ter and Gordon senior public liability partner Barrie Woollacott yesterday said they were encouraging the women to contact police and were investigating their claims as they considered seeking orders freezing Harris’s assets.\n\nHe said while Rolf Harris Enterprises was registered in Australia, it may have no ­assets here: “In order to ensure that that wealth remains available for the victims rather than being locked up in trusts or transferred, it’s important proceedings commence quickly so a freeze on those assets can be ordered by the court.’’\n\nNSW Police were not investigating allegations against Harris because they had not received any complaints, a spokesman said.\n\n","byline":"JANET FIFE-YEOMANS

Wednesday after the 25-year-old failed to show up for work. Searchers found his body about 11.30pm.\n\nQueanbeyan Acting Inspector Graeme Bailey told AAP the man was found in an ungroomed area near Guthega Creek in the NSW Snowy Mountains.\n\nIt is believed his death was a tragic accident.\n\n“We believe it was a tragic mishap, an investigation is under way,” Detective Inspector Shane Box of Queanbeyan police said.\n\nBULLER TRAGEDY: Boy, 7, killed in freak accident \n\nDetective Inspector Box said the man was a staff member at the Perisher resort.\n\n“This was a snowboarding accident,” he said.\n\nDetective Inspector Box said the tragedy served as a warning to others to take proper safety precautions when snowboarding, such as carrying an EPIRB tracking device.\n\nPolice found the man’s body around 11.30pm on Wednesday, less than an hour after his employer contacted police after the man failed to show up for his rostered shift.\n\nNSW Police say he had gone snowboarding earlier in the day and failed to return.\n\nThe man’s identity has not been released.\n\nA post mortem examination will be conducted to determine exactly how he died.\n\n“It’s obviously a very sad day for his family and the entire Perisher community; our condolences go out to the young man’s family and friends during this difficult time,” Perisher CEO Peter Brulisauer said today.\n\nThe tragic news comes at the same time a Narabeen man has told Fairfax Media of his miraculous rescue at Thredbo.\n\nMike Grace, 36, triggered an avalanche when he veered off course becoming trapped beneath almost 3m of snow unable to see or move with only a small space in front of his mouth for about an hour.\n\nMr Grace told Fairfax he screamed out to his childhood friend but went unheard. He said breathing slowly so that he didn’t run out of air probably saved him.\n\nIt’s the second death at an Australian snow resort in the past week.\n\nA seven-year-old boy, Haadi Akhtar, died on June 26 after being buried by snow that came loose from his lodge at Mt Buller in Victoria.\n\nHe was found nearly two hours after he went missing, just 40 metres from where he was last seen.\n\n","byline":"Network writers ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/news.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/nsw-act/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T06:31:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T06:32:07.000Z","description":"THE body of a ski resort worker who did not return home from a snowboarding session was found in a wooded area without trails.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fni0cx12-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s41-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s3x-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s3y-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s3z-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s40-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"aaa4585d3793bcd9bd23bb4777453429","keywords":["mortem examination","Initial inquiries"],"kicker":"Body found","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/mans-body-found-at-perisher-a-day-after-failing-to-turn-up-for-work/story-fnii5s40-1226976190473?sv=65a6eedcbaa1b4588fb749c9c82175f4","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976190473","originalAssetId":"1226976190473","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"08bab197d65a210e076104b44a56be6d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976743115","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A MALE employee of a resort at Perisher became the second ski season victim today when his body was found -

He has been regarded as the best in the game for a long time and has a mortgage on the Australian jumper and is captain of the country.\n\nBRISBANE BEWARE, BLUE CREW IS COMING \n\nPRESSURE OFF AS BLUES EYE THREE-PEAT \n\n“For me it’s about proving myself every time I play against him.\n\n“I’d like to think that not only this year but every time I’ve come up against him at club or at this (Origin) level, I’ve shown that he is not better than me.\n\n“I still believe that. It doesn’t change if we’ve won or not. That’s my mindset, whether it’s him or anyone else.\n\n“One thing he has been praised for is his calmness and consistency and it’s something I continue to work on. I believe in what I do and the way I prepare and play.”\n\nFarah said he has been in career-best form recently in a sixth-placed Tigers team that was tipped to struggle this season.\n\n“You don’t like hearing that [Smith is better],” Farah said.\n\n“It has taken me a while to get back in this (Origin) arena. I was out of it for a couple of years.\n\n“I think the last couple of years I’ve played the best footy I’ve played in my career. Definitely the most consistent footy.\n\n“That’s something I was criticised for in the past — my flair and the options I took. I like to think my consistency has improved.”\n\nFarah does concede though he will struggle to oust Smith as Kangaroos hooker.\n\nCHAMBERS ASSAULT CLAIM ROCKS MAROONS \n\nAsked was there anything he could do to become Australia’s starting hooker, Farah said: “Probably not. Unless he gets an injury and I wouldn’t wish that upon him.\n\n“It’s always pretty hard going into the Aussie camp knowing you are playing second fiddle waiting for your time. I never quite feel part of the side even though you are in the squad.\n\n“That’s the way it is, that is something you have to deal with. I am lucky to have played for Australia. Some guys never get the chance and I am grateful for the chance I had but I am also realistic and know where I stand and I am fine with that.\n\n“Some people didn’t even think I should have been in the last squad. Some d**khead journalist in Queensland — I’d love to see him for a couple of minutes on a footy field.”\n\nNSW back-rower Ryan Hoffman spoke glowingly about Farah and Smith.\n\n“Cam is the best player I have ever played with,” Hoffman said.\n\n“I have been lucky enough to play with him for 13 years. He has had a lot of success. Robbie wouldn’t have had his success if he didn’t believe in his ability or believe in the type of player he is.\n\n“Robbie’s confidence and the belief he has in himself rubs off on his teammates. That is why Robbie has been so good at the Tigers.”\n\n","byline":"Dean Ritchie Coffs Harbour","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/Origin/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/State of Origin -

Some later editions also contained Tickets of Leave, Pardons or Certificates of Freedom as well as details of any further crimes a convict committed in the colony.\n\nThey give a fascinating insight into the pre-photography appearances of the times and show the astonishing prevalence of body art.\n\nIn fact in 1831, of the 3000 convicts transported to New South Wales about 30 per cent of the men and 10 per cent of the women were recorded as having some form of inking 1.\n\nAnother mystery of the heart found in these records is the case of Thomas Hicken. A 21-year-old farm hand from Cheshire, Thomas was convicted to life transportation to NSW for the crime of sheep stealing in 1834.\n\nThomas is described in the Convict Indents as 5’10” with brown eyes and brown hair and the following tattoos: a man, “when this you see, remember me and bear me in your mind” on torso; a man and woman, flowerpot, two birds, “true love” on lower right arm, man standing on an anchor, fish, on upper left arm; bird on a branch, 1831, woman and basket, on lower left arm; anchor back of left hand, blue ring on fourth finger of same, scar outside left leg.\n\nIt seems that Thomas had a sweetheart who he’d left behind in England, however his marital status is listed in is indent as “single”. Was his de facto sweetheart the woman with a basket tattooed onto his left arm? Did they meet in 1831?\n\nNot much else is known about Thomas, and he doesn’t appear in any records for the next 64 years. As was common in those days, family members in England who were looking for relatives abroad placed advertisements in newspapers or police gazettes in an attempt to find information about them.\n\nIt seems that someone with the same last name as Thomas, from his home town of Cheshire, was looking for him and placed a Missing Friends ad in an 1898 NSW Police Gazette: “Inquiry requested as to the whereabouts of Thomas Hicken or Higgin. Arrived in this Colony by the ship “Henry Porcher” in 1835.\n\nDescription on arrival: 21 years of age, 5’10”, sallow complexion, pockpitted, brown hair brown eyes; single; a farm servant; a native of Cheshire. Inquiries at the instance of William Thomas Hicken, 17 Regent St, Moulton, near Northwick, Cheshire”.\n\nIf still alive, Thomas would have been 84 by the time this advertisement was posted. Was this man looking for him possibly his illegitimate son, named after him by a lonely sweetheart left behind in England?\n\nInterestingly, the tattoos listed in the indents often held different meanings in the 19th century, with popular tattoos such as an anchor not symbolising a career as a mariner but rather symbolising one’s faith or hope.\n\nSome convicts, like 13-year-old William Robinson had only one or two tattoos: “five dots lower left arm, H back of left wrist”, with others such as 27-year-old William Martin adorned with strings of letters: “ ‘MBAMAGJMJMWNTM’ on right arm, ‘woman’, ‘WBABSBJBMNDM’ and ‘TM’ on left arm, ring on left third finger”.\n\nSmall groups of letters have been interpreted as possible initials of a loved one, with larger groups of letters maybe referring to a biblical phrase or political slogan of which the meaning is now lost.\n\nLooking at the records, it appears the five dots are a consistent form of convict tattoo, among both men and women. Although we don’t have a definitive understanding for what these dots mean, Tasmanian professor and convict expert, Hamish Maxwell-Stewart, has a theory: “the five dots tattoo which persisted into the 1870s probably means ‘I have been inside’.\n\nThe four outer dots are thought to represent the corners of the cell and the central one the prisoner.”\n\nAlthough we may not know what they meant, we do know that the edgy tattooed hipsters of today are simply following a trend as old as the colonies.\n\n","byline":"Staff writes ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Top News/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T03:36:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T03:36:25.000Z","description":"ELIZABETH Brazier was 26 when she was convicted of highway robbery in London in 1838 and sentenced to 15 years’ transportation to NSW.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pierced-hearts-anchors-and-flower-pots-the-history-of-convict-tattoos/story-fni0cx4q-1226976286398?sv=ff805ed9ca82d208fdcdb9769f189846","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au"],"id":"78a1c19ae4e046b48bacf5b2abac95de","keywords":["family history","online family","family history resource","family history records","online family history","online family resource","family story","family trees","historical records","family relative","key dates","genealogical records","right arm","body art","convict tattoos","National Library","anchor tatt","shipped convicts","cryptic collections","biblical passages","brown eyes","brown hair","blue ring","body tatts","edgy tattooed hipsters","life transportation","Convict body art","dots tattoo","basket tattooed","home town","Vintage body art","ship records show","William Thomas","farm hand","police gazettes","description column","family members","hair brown eyes","England","New South Wales","Australia","London","United Kingdom","Dubbo","University of Tasmania","William Stevens","Hamish Maxwell-Stewart","William \"Smokey\" Robinson","Jr.","William Martin","Matthew Newton","William Thomas Hicken"],"kicker":"Vintage body art","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pierced-hearts-anchors-and-flower-pots-the-history-of-convict-tattoos/story-fni0cx4q-1226976286398?sv=ff805ed9ca82d208fdcdb9769f189846","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976286398","originalAssetId":"1226976286398","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"5fc9dd4e9ea66ed9af3e1511a9542445","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976327571","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"OUR early convicts loved the sort of body art you would expect to see on modern day celebrities.

Lara in Sydney without Sam"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"But from the beginning there was something special.\n\nThat ability to perform under pressure, an innate drive to win that cannot be taught or learned. All it took was the right guidance, the right people, the right opportunities. And one heck of a first serve.\n\nNick Kyrgios grew up in Canberra to Greek dad George and Malaysian mum Norlaila — a talented badminton player.\n\nHe spent weekends playing ball boy to his tennis-loving brother Christos, eight years his senior, before picking up a racquet of his own.\n\nOnly then was he able to demonstrate an uncanny knack for hitting a ball where the other player wasn’t, and lightning hand-eye co-ordination that made up for his early lack of agility.\n\nBrent Larkham, head coach of the Australian Institute of Sport’s men’s tennis program, coached Kyrgios for two years until 2013 and followed his progress long before that.\n\n“He has always had that fearless approach that he showed against Nadal,” Larkham said yesterday.\n\n“He hits the ball big off both sides and he serves and returns extremely well, so it’s no surprise he’s done so well. It’s just a bit surprising that it happened so quickly.”\n\nLarkham admitted his former student’s movement was “never really that good”, but improved once he entered the AIS and focused on fitness.\n\n“When he came to the AIS program he had more physiotherapy and a lot more access to the gym and that really helped him,” he said.\n\n“But he has always had this incredible self-belief — he’s had that from day one. He’s not scared of any occasion. It has always been the bigger the match, the bigger he plays, and that is a hard thing to teach.”\n\nSuch confidence can translate to cockiness, but other mentors of Kyrgios said his feet were firmly on the ground.\n\nTracey Lea, a pastoral care adviser at Daramalan College, where Kyrgios completed his HSC, said Kyrgios was “a very bright boy”, popular with students and respected by teachers: “He is a really nice guy — friendly, funny and was always very physically engaged.\n\n“He didn’t ask for special treatment but I think all his peers recognised there was something pretty extraordinary about him.”\n\nMrs Lea said the loss of an uncle in a motorcycle accident while Kyrgios was in Year 11 “taught him about resilience and taught him that things can hurt you”.\n\n“He’s not all just exuberance, confidence and bravado — there is a really decent young man there, and a kind and intelligent boy as well,” she said.\n\nSuch qualities make him the perfect target for sponsorship and endorsement opportunities, according to Central Queensland University sports management expert Dr Danya Hodgetts.\n\nShe said Kyrgios’s success at Wimbledon could translate to deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, rising to millions if he keeps winning the big games.\n\n“The aim now is to capitalise on that success and leverage it as soon as possible to get sponsorships,” she said.\n\n“Certainly, he’ll get a good burst for the next 12 or 24 months, depending on what contracts he signs, and then it is really up to him being able to continue to succeed on-court and build his brand.”\n\nCHAMPIONS win big matches for a multitude of good reasons.\n\nSticking it to mum isn’t usually one of them.\n\nThat, however, is ­apparently what drove Nick Kyrgios to outclass the world’s No.1 early yesterday morning while most of Australia slept.\n\n“I saw in an interview that my mum thought Rafa was too good for me,” the towering 19-year-old said in a post-match interview at Wimbledon.\n\n“So that made me a little angry.”\n\nHe vowed to send an SMS smiley face to his mother, Norlaila, in response to her comment.\n\nDespite the excitement of her son’s famous win, mum was still simply calling just like she saw it yesterday.\n\nSpeaking to 3AW, Mrs Kyrgios wasn’t getting too excited about her son’s chances in his quarter-final match against Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\n“If he’s serving well he can get it,” she said.\n\n“But if he’s not serving well, then no.”\n\nAnd she had some motherly gems of advice for her youngest boy, who has rocketed from relative obscurity to the top echelon of his sport in just 18 months.\n\n“You just have to treat people nice, be nice to everybody, show them respect,” she said.\n\nJust goes to show: Mums aren’t always right ... but they usually are.\n\n","byline":"neil keene ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and

in crowd figures in the final four rounds from stay-at-home fans at a time when attendance figures have just recovered from a disastrous start to the year.\n\nSenior NRL officials don’t want anything to do with 7.45pm Thursday kick-offs but are legally obliged, under its contract with Channel Nine, to include five matches in the timeslot on the schedule every season for the next four years.\n\nThe Thursday nights schedule includes:\n\n*Round 23 Rabbitohs v Broncos at ANZ Stadium;\n\n*Round 24 Eels v Sea Eagles at Parramatta Stadium\n\n*Round 25 Bulldogs v Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium; and\n\n*Round 26 Roosters v Rabbitohs at Allianz Stadium.\n\nThe TV deal was done by the previous administration before Dave Smith took over.\n\nFans voiced their outrage on social media on Tuesday afternoon over the Thursday night scheduling.\n\n“More the reason to not be a member, impossible to get families to Nrl = clowns.” said David on Twitter.\n\n“Once again made for television only — not made for the fans. Regional fans locked out of games due to travel, said Matt Roberts.\n\nThe club were not happy either.\n\nBulldogs CEO Raelene Castle said the club was disappointed with the scheduling of the Rabbitohs blockbuster in Round 25 on a Thursday night.\n\n“On a Sunday afternoon we would have got 40 to 50,000,” she said.\n\n“On a Thursday night it’s far more challenging and probably more like 30,000.\n\n“I know we have a broadcaster that pays us a lot of money but the network would also prefer to have a product with full stadiums.”\n\nChannel Nine boss David Gyngell was sticking to his guns last night when asked about the impact the scheduling had on fans and clubs.\n\n“It gives fans an extra live game each week on free-to-air,” Gyngell said.\n\n“And it gives the NRL a bigger build-up to the semi-finals.\n\n“The clubs have got to remember they used to get grants of $4.5 million and they’re now getting $7 million from the money we and Fox Sports are paying them.\n\n“The money they get from television is more than what they might lose in crowds.”\n\nSouth Sydney played the Roosters on a Thursday night in round one to launch the season on a Thursday night and attracted only 27,000 fans on a school night.\n\nAs a result, round one crowds were down by 20 per cent.\n\nHad it been played 24 hours later on the more traditional Friday night kick-off time at ANZ Stadium, officials believe they would have got 40,000 to the game.\n\nCrowds have since recovered after 16 rounds to be level with last year’s figures.\n\nThe competition’s most overexposed team, the Broncos, have again drawn prime-time spots in five of the last six rounds.\n\nThe Eels too were disappointed at having their blockbuster against Manly in Round 24 scheduled on a Thursday night.\n\n“While we do value our broadcast partners, it’s important that the interests of our 18,000 members are also considered in these decisions,” said CEO Scott Seward.\n\n“Thursday night football can be difficult for families and this will obviously impact the crowd for such an important game.”\n\n","byline":"Phil Rothfield Sports Editor-at-Large

prisons, some jails have been forced to house three inmates in cells designed for two, with concerns there are not enough guards to safely handle the increase.\n\nThe revelation comes after Opposition Leader John Robertson ­accused the government of relaxing the bail laws to make room in jails.\n\nAttorney-General Brad Hazzard has since ordered an urgent review of the laws. The Public Service Association’s prison officers branch has voted unanimously to refuse entry to new prisoners at jails where there government is trying to increase prisoner numbers.\n\nThe Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research warned this year that the prison population was at a record high of 10,917 and was expected to rise by another 17 per cent — to 12,500 inmates — by next March.\n\nBOCSAR warned the explosion in the prison population was a “significant concern” and sources within government are spooked that a ­“crisis” is looming.\n\nPrison Officers Vocational Branch chair Steve McMahon said prison ­officers were sick of being “human punching bags” and regularly had ­unsafe staffing levels.\n\n“In some jails it’s not uncommon for 20 prison officers to be on duty to supervise more than 300 inmates,” Mr McMahon said.\n\nA Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman said the “three-out” cells had been used for decades when there was a fluctuation in the prison population, and affected 80 cells across the system: “This means about 2 per cent of all inmates are housed in three-out cells. The use of three-out cells is a short-term measure. We are also planning for new accommodation buildings to be built at existing prisons and, in the longer term, building new prisons if and as required.”\n\nIn 2011 the state government closed three prisons that housed a total of 900 inmates.\n\nMr McMahon said prison officers did not have a safe working environment and would campaign for the same WorkCover provisions as police\n\n","byline":"Alicia Wood Political Reporter","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/news.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/themercury.com.au/Network News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/nsw-act/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"dailytelegraph.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T14:19:09.000Z","description":"NSW jail inmates are being crammed three-to-a cell as prison guards threaten to refuse entry to new inmates because of concerns the jail system is dangerously overcrowded.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fni0cx12-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s41-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s3x-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.themercury.com.au/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnj3twbb-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"themercury.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s3y-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s3z-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s40-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","themercury.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"c73352d483e94b6da51cf4bbd8ba2550","keywords":["prison officers","prison population","state government","three-out cells","bail laws","urgent review","human punching bags","John Robertson","Steve McMahon","Bradley Ronald Hazzard","jail inmates","jail system","three-to-a cell","prison officers branch","unsafe staffing levels","prisoner numbers"],"kicker":"Exclusive","link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/full-to-the-crim-inmate-blowout-in-nsw-jails-with-three-people-per-cell/story-fnii5s3z-1226975738515?sv=aaabee7bfbb2c95b2b48a213178b4283","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975738515","originalAssetId":"1226975738515","originalSource":"DailyTelegraph","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/DailyTelegraph/NSW News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"bcb3a22227138784b3d3b4e3ac925e6e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975738006","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"NSW jail inmates are being crammed three-to-a cell as prison guards threaten to refuse entry to new inmates because of concerns the jail system is dangerously overcrowded.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Full to the crim: inmate blow-out in NSW jails with three people per cell","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Full to the crim: Jails’ inmate blow-out","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8ff55ade-01a0-11e4-aaf7-dc6e5517e581 -

You look at the game on the weekend (versus Newcastle), we didn’t have a finals attitude and we should have wrapped that game up.\n\n“If we had a better mentality and more experience we would have won. We went close, don’t get me wrong.\n\n“We are definitely still in the hunt. We just need to find a bit of rhythm, that’s all we are lacking. We are a good team but not a great team at the moment.”\n\nParramatta has a big, fast and young football side.\n\nWith Arthur moulding the future, Parramatta is poised to yet again become a rugby league force.\n\n“In the next couple of years when we can fix up our salary cap and start to buy marquee players, that will help as well,” Hayne said.\n\nAsked was Parramatta about to sign Bulldogs centre Krisnan Inu, Hayne said: “I think there was (some talk about that).\n\n“The last time I spoke to him, he was um-ing and ar-ing.”\n\nHayne is now back in camp with NSW and ready to star again in Origin III at Suncorp Stadum next Wednesday night.\n\nThe brilliant fullback was in tears after securing the historic series win in Sydney. They were television images that will forever be etched into Origin folklore.\n\n“It was emotional and it was a long time coming,” Hayne said.\n\n“It kind of caught up with me, especially seeing some of the older boys, Robbie, ‘Lukey’ (Lewis) and ‘Gal’ (Paul Gallen).\n\n“To be apart of it was huge and special.”\n\nHayne denied this game should be referred to as a “dead rubber”.\n\n“Everyone who has pulled on the jersey wants to win,” Hayne said.\n\nAsked would Queensland come out fighting given their series failure, Hayne said: “You’d think so. I am sure they are going to want to win on their home ground.\n\n“This game will be just as important as the first two. Origin is Origin, it wouldn’t matter whether we have been beaten 25 games in a row or won 25 games in a row.\n\n“You want to win.”\n\nHayne has been simply stunning in this year’s series, particularly game one in Brisbane.\n\n“I try and play my best every week and try and do my thing,” he said.\n\n","byline":"Dean Ritchie

Or at a pinch, the mercurial Brett Kenny.\n\nMaybe even Ken Thornett — that 1960s fullback they dubbed ‘The Mayor of Parramatta’ - for those whose memories stretch back far enough.\n\nBut then Cronin comes along and pips them all.\n\nMore unassuming than an Amish wardrobe, the bush hotelier was on Wednesday night crowned ‘Champion of Parramatta’ in a gala ceremony at The Star.\n\nHere, truly, was a result equal parts surprising and apt.\n\nRemembering that in Michael William Cronin, you have a footballer who represented Australia while still playing for Gerringong.\n\nA centre who would eventually retire with not only more points than any Kangaroo, but anyone who ever played the game before him.\n\nCronin was strong. Evasive. A footballer back when the phrase meant plenty.\n\nAnd ball skills? Here was a fella who could put you through the eye of a needle if required.\n\nFamously commuting from his south coast hometown, the Crow would eventually play 10 years and 216 games for his beloved Eels.\n\nStaying true despite rival offers — which allegedly included offers of a helicopter ride on game day by Manly — and a serious injury to his eye.\n\nSo, sure, by the end he had one peeper and a waddle.\n\nFor most rivals, it was still too much.\n\n","byline":"Nick Walshaw ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL

the Tigers spiritual home, Leichhardt Oval, the same suburban venue where his uncle carved out a ball-playing reputation in the 1980s.\n\nWhereas Elias brought cheek and creative flair out of dummy-half, Moses has played the majority of his junior football in the halves, starring in the Australian Schoolboys class of 2012 alongside fellow Tigers young gun Luke Brooks.\n\nOn Sunday against the table-topping Panthers, Moses is expected to get an opportunity playing fullback after James Tedesco suffered a broken knee cap last weekend, ruling him out for up to 12 weeks.\n\nFortuitously, Moses will get the perfect tutor to help him adapt to the intricacies of wearing the no.1 jumper in Tigers coach Mick Potter, who won two Dally M Medals playing fullback in 1984 and 1991.\n\nWhen contacted by The Daily Telegraph, Potter said Moses had been training at fullback this week because the club was still awaiting a fitness report on Blake Austin, who sustained an ankle injury last weekend.\n\n“We’ve got to see how Blake Austin is, he’s having a bit of trouble with his ankle,” Potter said.\n\n“Mitchell’s on standby. He trained with the side the other day because Blake was sick and I’m waiting for the physio to give me a call.\n\n“It could work out Mitchell does play but we will give Blake ample opportunity to recover.”\n\nMoses was previously slated to make his NRL debut in round nine against premiers Sydney Roosters before being suspended for two weeks for making a homophobic slur in the under 20s State of Origin fixture.\n\nThe ascension of Moses to the NRL continues the strong family ties from the Balmain Tigers side which played in the 1988 and 1989 grand finals, where Wayne Pearce, Paul Sironen, Steve Roach, Garry Jack and Elias were all club icons.\n\nSironen’s son, Curtis, recently returned from a foot injury and has been earmarked as an NRL star of the future for the past couple of seasons, Pearce’s son Mitchell has played NRL since age 17 while Jack’s son Kieran is a star for the Sydney Swans in the AFL.\n\nMoses, Brooks and Sironen were all products of the renowned rugby league nursery Holy Cross Ryde.\n\n","byline":"James Hooper ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/NRL Teams/Wests

Bechtel’s demands that the workforce remain on a roster that means they work four weeks followed by one week off, a deal they agreed to in the previous enterprise agreement.\n\nUnions are demanding a 3 and 1 roster and have won approval to go to a vote of workers for protected action. Bechtel’s offer has already been rejected twice by the workers.\n\nAdding tension to the issue is that gas has already started to arrive at the island, piped from the Surat Basin, and one company, QGC, is scheduled to start exporting to Asia in December while others have another year.\n\nBechtel has fired back warning the workers of potential lock outs and stand downs of non-striking workers if unions take action.\n\nKEEP READING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH WORKERS EARN\n\nMore news... \n‘YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE, MR BADEN-CLAY?’ \nBIKER ‘ATTACK’ LEADS TO THE UNEXPECTED \nKARL RIBS SYLVIA OVER ROAST AND ROMANCE \n\nThe affected workers are some of the best paid tradesman in Queensland with electricians earning $160,000 and labourers earning $135,000, but the toll of working away from home for four weeks straight of 10-hour days is telling and even the company admits it’s not for everyone, but that is also the reason they are highly paid.\n\nIt has also offered an average 13 per cent pay rise as part of the new enterprise agreement.\n\nBechtel has warned that its offer is only on the table until the end of July and that it will not buckle to demands.\n\n“Bechtel can respond to those employees taking protected industrial action by taking action itself,’’ a note distributed to Curtis Island supervisors said.\n\n“An example of this is that Bechtel can lock out employees who have taken protected industrial action. Such lock outs can be for an indefinite period.’’\n\nIt said it also had the right to stand down sections of the workforce who cannot be productively employed.\n\n“These employees may not be the ones taking protected industrial action but nevertheless will lose money because of that action,” Bechtel said.\n\n“It is business as usual at the projects. The existing agreement, though it expired on June 5, stays in place until it is terminated or replaced.\n\n“The deal on the table is a fair and reasonable deal for all parties with many concessions won by the workforce, particularly in the current economic environment.\n\n“These projects were planned to 4 and 1 rosters and non-local employees signed up to a 10-hour work day and that will not change for these projects.’’\n\nThe unions did not respond yesterday.\n\nMore news...\n\n‘YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE, MR BADEN-CLAY?’\n\nGERARD Baden-Clay has faced a barrage of prosecution accusations that he overpowered and probably smothered his wife Allison before dumping her body.

All the seats were taken, except one.\n\nThree Aboriginal men were sitting in a four-berth seat by the door, where most people were crowded around. I hesitated for a second, to make sure nobody else was heading for the seat, and then walked through the standing passengers and asked if the seat was being used.\n\nThe men, having been sitting quietly, suddenly perked up and the man sitting next to the empty seat smiled and said, “No, you can sit here, please”. So I did.\n\nTo begin with, the men were quiet and respectful and didn’t talk or look at me. I could sense some discomfort so I made a comment about how cold it was. This was met with more smiles and nods of agreement.\n\nVIDEO: Vile racist rant on Sydney train \n\nA minute or so later one of the men broke the ice by asking me what the time was, and when I thought the train would be leaving. Soon we were talking about all sorts of things.\n\nWe discussed the footy (they were supporting the wrong team), arguing about the cricket (you can’t go for the West Indies having just left Adelaide Oval), and laughing about netball — the oldest man’s wife loves it and we all agreed it is terrible.\n\nWe also discovered how many of the same places we had visited. They come from Alice Springs and I have travelled as far north as Pukatja and the surrounding towns. We discussed donkeys and camels and what I had been doing there — in 2005 I had travelled up with a rock band to take live music to the APY communities.\n\nAs the men reached their destination, they stood up and called out goodbyes and waved to the other passengers. The oldest man said ‘‘God bless you mob’’ before exiting the carriage. As the doors closed I waved one last time to the last guy saying, ‘‘See ya sis’’, and from behind me I heard the words, ‘‘Thank God”.\n\nI thought for a second, decided to ignore the comment, and started to put in my headphones. Then I was tapped on the shoulder, and a comment was made along the lines of ‘‘Bet you’re relieved — those people really shouldn’t be allowed to drink!’’, followed by nervous giggling.\n\nI turned to see a group of women sitting in the seats behind me, looking concerned and sympathetic. I removed the earphone, took a deep breath, and launched quietly into speech along the following lines:\n\n“Excuse me! Those men were the friendliest, most polite people I have sat with on a train in years. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting with them and it completely sucks that when they got off, I was left sitting on a train amid a bunch of rude women, surrounded by an entire train full of white people who I am sure represent the very destruction of the traditional home of those men.\n\n“Yet if anyone on the train had made the effort to speak to or even look at one of these blokes, they would have been treated with respect and friendliness.\n\n“As for the alcohol you believed you could smell on them, yes, they have been at the football and had a couple of drinks, as did you obviously, but the alcohol you can smell is from me. I served hundreds of people today and am covered in beer and wine.\n\n“Don’t you dare even think about responding to me right now, you disgust me and should be ashamed of yourselves”.\n\nA small section of the carriage near us applauded quietly. One of the women cried, and the majority pretended they weren’t even on the train and had heard nothing. Maybe they didn’t. But they will now.\n\n■ ■ ■ ■\n\nMy mother grew up along the South Australian section of The Ghan train line. My family has travelled extensively through the Outback on holidays as children and teenagers, and I was brought up to be aware of, respectful towards, interested in and involved with indigenous Australian culture.\n\nI studied subjects relating to it at university. I understand, as much as I can being of British descent, what happened here and how the effects will be felt forever. But to be confronted with it first-hand in 2014 by people who an hour earlier were screaming together with these men in elation for Eddie Betts  was so hypocritical and disappointing.\n\nI posted this story as a Facebook  status on Monday afternoon, and not 24 hours later it had received more than 9000 likes — 36 hours later it has more than doubled. The response has been overwhelming, and I have received so many messages of congratulations and thanks, from across the state, country and the world.\n\nI am so glad the message has been received so positively by so many. However I am not looking for congratulations, as one woman has accused me of doing.\n\nI merely did what I was raised to do, and stood up for what was right. I did what everybody should be doing.\n\nI, like so many, hope to one day live in an Australia without division. We act like we have that, but the responses to my status have shown me that this still happens every day, often to the faces of the victims, and their children after them.\n\nThe education is there, the pathways are being paved, but so often we find that the minority is much louder. We see these stories of racism, often going unanswered. We hear about how it is ‘‘justified’’. We see responses to stories such as mine talking about how I must have run into the “good ones’’.\n\nI just hope that by standing up and defending my new friends, and then sharing my story with others who may wish they had had the courage to do the same in a similar situation once, I can show people how much good it can do to convince yourself that you’re brave, just for 20 seconds.\n\nThis is not an acceptable way to live. Someone wrote to me this week: “Reconciliation is just a word unless we live it’’. And that does go both ways. I am not saying racism is one-sided. But somebody needs to be willing to start trying.\n\nWhy not you?\n\nBrooke Skewes works in the hospitality industry and is a regular train commuter.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Skewes ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Opinion/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T01:17:49.000Z","description":"ON Sunday night following the Showdown in Adelaide, I finished work and headed to the train station.

I’m just so glad that it’s brought about more awareness of Crohn’s disease, and it’s made me feel so much more confident.”\n\nBethany was fitted with her colostomy bags after battling with Crohn’s disease since the age of three. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, affecting the sufferer’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste.\n\nIn extreme situations like Bethany’s, it becomes necessary to remove the damaged section of the intestine and bring the healthy part out as a stoma — known as a colostomy.\n\nAfter almost dying when her bowel ruptured in 2010, Bethany woke from a life-saving operation to find she had been fitted with two colostomy bags.\n\n“Growing up I’d had various surgeries to try and combat the Crohn’s,” said Townsend. “I’d go in and have sections of my intestine cut out, but I’d only be in remission for a couple of weeks before it came back again.\n\n“Then, four years ago I woke up in the morning and couldn’t move because I was in so much agony. I had to break a glass on the floor to alert my mum who called on ambulance. When the paramedics came they lifted up my top to see that my surgery scar had split open. I was rushed to intensive care where they doctors told me family I would need more surgery as my intestines had become infected and inflamed again. I had no idea when I woke up that I would have the bags.\n\n“When I first woke up and my mum told me about them I was just relieved as I’d thought I was going to die. When I came out of hospital and everything finally sunk in, I remember going upstairs into my bedroom and just bursting into tears.\n\n“I’d known a colostomy bag might have been an option but it was always something that I had wanted to avoid. I had a really good cry that day, and since then I haven’t shed another tear — I’ve just got on with it I suppose.”\n\nIt was only after Townsend met and married her husband, Ian, 33, and jetted off to Mexico last Christmas that she finally felt ready to embrace the colostomy bags.\n\n“When I met Ian I showed him my bags straight away, but he didn’t bat an eye lid — I actually felt like I was overreacting,” she said.\n\n“He taught me that there was more to me than the bags and would always encourage me to show off my figure. I wasn’t sure but in Mexico I finally realised he was right, and decided to wear my bikini.\n\n“At first I was nervous and worried that people would stare but it was fine. The staff at the hotel asked me about the bags on the last day of the holiday, but rather than being offended I was glad because it meant I could talk to them about Crohn’s and tell them what it is.\n\n“I decided to get in touch with Crohn’s and Colitis UK Facebook group to see if they would let me post something on their page. I sent them the picture and my information, and it all blew up from there.”\n\nTownsend still suffers from Crohn’s disease and hopes ones day for a cure, but for now she is considering getting back into modelling — a career she gave up on after she was fitted with the bags.\n\n“I feel confident enough now to put myself out there and pursue modelling again,” she said.\n\n“I did a little bit of work here and there before I had the colostomy bags, but once I had them fitted I thought that was the end of the dream. I’m looking forward to chasing my goals, and I know now that nothing can hold me back.\n\n“I won’t let the Crohn’s control me anymore.”\n\n","byline":"Caters News ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle -

This income protection should be for illnesses or injuries that are not eligible for workers compensation or other compensation schemes.”\n\nIt also argued staff should be able to be absent for 15 days’ personal leave without needing documentation. It wants it increased from eight days.\n\nSenator Bernardi labelled the document “ridiculous”.\n\n“There’s eight pages of demands but no acknowledgment of getting better value for taxpayers,” he said.\n\nCory Bernardi fires up online readers \n\nDepartment heads will sign more than 120 agreements across the public service but the new terms are subject to Government framework, which was released in March.\n\nThe Government will not agree to any pay increases unless there are clear productivity gains.\n\n","byline":"Renee Viellaris Federal Politics","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T15:01:06.000Z","description":"TAX office public servants want Australians to pay their income protection in case they get cancer – at the same time they’ve asked for more smoking breaks.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v71-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnihsrf2-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v70-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v6y-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v6u-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"c55a039693dadfbe49226cb2732604bd","keywords":["income protection","personal leave","long-term illnesses","public service sweeteners","public transport timetables","enterprise agreements","Department heads","work outside","heart disease","Federal Politics","community expectations","Tax Office","Cory Bernardi","public service","public servants","minute tea breaks","clear productivity gains","workers compensation","compensation schemes","smoking breaks","Government framework"],"kicker":"Perks claim","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnihsrf2-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975637264","originalAssetId":"1226975637264","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"499f2248102bb8cfb3387332f5bf7de9","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"NnMnI3bjrfWw1WomqdHan3kV4NrnBNna","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f6ba2491b3d9942345ce088f27e0c123","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975639483","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THESE workers want you to pay their income protection in case they get cancer – at the same time they’ve asked for more smoking breaks.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Australia Services Union seeks extra smoking breaks for tax office staff ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["GoranMihajlovski"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"More smokos -

Probably as you smothered her. And took the life from her.’’\n\nBaden-Clay denied the accusation.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 14: Drug in Allison had ‘unusual effects’ \n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nMr Fuller told the court by April 19, 2012, the double-life Baden-Clay had been leading was about to come undone.\n\nHe said April 19 was when Baden-Clay discovered his wife and long-term lover Toni McHugh would be at the same real estate conference the following day.\n\n“If those two women came together on the 20th, there was a real risk of a catastrophe,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“Your double life would be exposed.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had promised Allison the affair was over when she had discovered his infidelity the previous September.\n\n“Your wife had forgiven you once,’’ he said.\n\n“You had no confidence she would forgive you again, did you?\n\n“And if that came about, you’d be exposed to your family, to your friends, to your profession.\n\n“The facade that was Gerard Baden-Clay will fall.’’\n\nKEEP READING TO SEE THE PROSECUTOR’S DRAMATIC INTERROGATION\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had murdered his wife at their Brookfield home, either late on the night of the 19th or during the early hours of the following morning.\n\nBut he said the former real estate agent was back home by 1.48am — when he plugged his phone back into its charger.\n\n“Perhaps she grabbed at your clothing? Is that why you had that injury under your right shoulder?’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n Baden-Clay said he could not explain how he got the red bruising near his armpit.\n\n“Perhaps her jumper came up as you tried to fight her off, up over her hands and up around her neck, or did that happen later as you moved her body and dumped her in the creek?’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“You overpowered her pretty quickly, didn’t you?\n\nBaden-Clay, often exasperated and sometimes angry during the barrage, rejected this. “I never overpowered her at all,’’ he said.\n\n“I never did anything to physically harm my wife in any way, ever. So your supposition that then takes it further to suggest I did other things as well is absurd and I object to it. I can’t answer your question.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Allison’s hair came into contact with the blanket of fallen leaves in their back garden as he took her to the Captiva car.\n\nHe told Baden-Clay she had a minor injury, something that had caused her to bleed. He said when Baden-Clay put his wife’s body in the back of her car, with the rear seats folded flat to form a boot, her blood had run down the side. “It wasn’t enough to be noticed but enough to be found,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“You transported her to Kholo Creek and then dumped her underneath the bridge unceremoniously.\n\n“Anxious to get back to your children.’’\n\nThe suggestion that Baden-Clay had abandoned his three daughters upset him.\n\n“The suggestion that I would leave my children for any time in the middle of the night is absurd, let alone to do the dastardly things that you’re suggesting,’’ Baden-Clay said. It was then, Mr Fuller said, that Baden-Clay began covering his tracks.\n\nHe loaded toys into the back of his wife’s Captiva. He took his razor and used it to cut his face at the bottom of the scratch marks to “give some legitimacy’’ to the claim he would make again and again.\n\nThe claim he had made that morning and during his trial: the marks on his face were shaving cuts, done in a hurry. “You told … anybody who asked,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“And you kept up the facade of a concerned husband.’’ Baden-Clay denied all allegations.\n\nThe trial continues on Monday.\n\nGERARD TELLS COURT OF MANY AFFAIRS\n\nGERARD Baden-Clay has told a court he had ``many concurrent’’ affairs as he played down his long-term relationship with lover Toni McHugh.\n\nAnswering final questions in his murder trial, Baden-Clay yesterday for the first time alluded to the presence of more women in his life.\n\n``It was purely about the physical aspect of that, that I went to those other women,’’ he said, under questioning from his defence barrister.\n\n``Some of them over an extended period of time, admittedly. Many of them concurrent. But I felt like we’d put that behind us and moved on.’\n\nThe court had previously been told of Baden-Clay’s affairs with three women. One was with Ms McHugh, which lasted more than three years.\n\nAnother was with a woman at a real estate conference in Sydney, while he was with Ms McHugh.\n\nAnd the third was from earlier in his marriage, long before Ms McHugh, he has testified previously.\n\nMs McHugh was more than just a fling, prosecutor Todd Fuller QC suggested to Baden-Clay yesterday.\n\n``I suggest that you wanted to be with Toni McHugh,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\nBaden-Clay replied: That’s not correct.\n\n``She offered things that you didn’t get from the wife that you no longer loved,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\nBaden-Clay replied: ``No, that’s not true’’. He insisted he still loved his wife.\n\n``Allison and I had been through a period of about nine years where we had hardly had any physical intimacy at all,’’ he said.\n\n``Yes there were a number of women that I went to for sex. Talked about some of them during that period.\n\n``But Allison and I had recommenced our physical relationship and were rebuilding that.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay split from Ms McHugh in September 2011 after Allison discovered the affair, but went back to her three months later.\n\n``I’d suggest to you that Toni McHugh offered you a different life and that you wanted to take that opportunity,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n``That’s why you went back to her … because you realised you made the wrong choice in September 2011.\n\n``That’s what the start of 2012 was all about: You and Toni McHugh planning how you were going to be living together.’’\n\nGerard insisted Ms McHugh was just another of his affairs. ``I’d had a number of infidelities over the years,’’ he said.\n\n``The difference with Toni McHugh to the other women was that she worked together in the office with us. That made life a lot more challenging.’’\n\n","byline":"Kate Kyriacou and David Murray ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T04:14:28.000Z","description":"YOU killed her.

of upsetting world No 1 Rafael Nadal 24 hours earlier, has been railroaded out of the All England Club by huge-serving Milos Raonic.\n\nTHE END: EXHAUSTED, SORE AND NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE \n\nBIG FAN: ROGER RATES KID KYRGIOS \n\nUK HOPE: MURRAY KNOCKED OUT OF WIMBLEDON \n\nLEGEND: FEDERER MOVES CLOSER TO RECORD \n\nREPLAY ALL THE ACTION FROM OUR LIVE BLOG BELOW\n\nThe eighth seed preyed on tiring Kyrgios to advance 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-4 7-6 (7-4) to a semi-final meeting with seven-time champion Roger Federer.\n\nFederer reached his 35th grand slam semi-final — and ninth at Wimbledon — with a 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-4 win over fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka as Raonic banished Krygios.\n\nExhausted and frustrated at not being able to secure a last-four appointment with his idol Federer, Kyrgios leaves Wimbledon knowing that he has the game to return and eventually win it.\n\nSupported by 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt, Ken Rosewall and Tony Roche, Kyrgios clearly struggled to recover from ousting Nadal.\n\nAs disappointed as he was to lose to Raonic, who cannoned down 39 aces, Krygios has plenty of reasons for positives.\n\n“Never did I think that I was ever going to make quarter-finals of Wimbledon and beat (Rafael) Nadal on centre court,” said Kyrgios after the match.\n\n“It’s all happened pretty fast.\n\n“I don’t think it’s completely sunk in yet, you know, the achievement. I’m just going to reflect on that the next couple days.”\n\nScheduled to contest Newport next week, the Canberran rises to a career-high mark of world No 66 and banks a prizemoney cheque of $432,000, almost doubling his career haul.\n\nBut Raonic, the first Canadian male to reach the semi-finals here, was a bridge too far.\n\nThe world No 9 was relieved and elated to have staved off Kyrgios.\n\n“It hasn’t really sunk in,” he said post-match.\n\n“To have that kind of win is pretty special.\n\n“It’s another step forward, the goal is to be the No 1 player in the world and this is another step towards that goal.”\n\nAttempting to become the first Wimbledon debutant to reach the semi-finals since David Nalbandian in 2002, Kyrgios lacked zip in the first set against Raonic.\n\nBut he showed plenty of class and resilience by winning, despite the Canadian having more — and better — opportunities.\n\nA framed forehand in the tiebreak rewarded Kyrgios’s doggedness but it became obvious he was running on fumes.\n\nBroken twice in the second set to allow Raonic to draw level, Kyrgios bounced back in the third set to claim an immediate break before leading 2-0.\n\nA few minutes later, he was back on the ropes as Raonic rolled through five successive games.\n\nKyrgios’s fatigue was illustrated in the botched smash he dumped into the net as Raonic maintained focus and intensity to keep the young Australian at bay.\n\n“I think it (the Nadal match) had a pretty big impact,” he said.\n\n“I was struggling physically about halfway through the second set. I was feeling sore in a couple places.\n\n“But I’m not going to take any credit away from him (Raonic) He served unbelievable.\n\n“I thought I came out strong on his first return game. I made him earn that.\n\n“All the other service games it looked like he was in such a rhythm that I just couldn’t do anything out there.”\n\nThe lanky right-hander methodically secured the third set, leaving Kyrgios with a huge task to reach the last four.\n\nKyrgios battled valiantly, regrouping to force a tiebreak.\n\nBut once there, he faltered leaving Raonic to cruise 6-1. There would be one final twist as Kyrgios saved three match points before Raonic hammered home a clinching ace.\n\nKyrgios bowed out to the acclaim of Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n“He’s a pretty exciting player to watch,” Dimitrov said. “Obviously he’s got a lot of skills and talent.”\n\nDjokovic was similarly generous.\n\n“Kyrgios just got into the mix in this tournament. He’s a 19-yearold, which is amazing.\n\n“It’s good for tennis to see that, because we lacked a little bit of successful teenagers in the last 10 years or so.\n\n“So we have these youngsters coming up, fearless on the court, hitting the ball, you know, not caring who is across the net.\n\n“It’s good. You know, it gets more attention to new faces and to new wave of generation that is able to challenge the best and be contending for grand slam titles.”\n\nKrygios stamped himself as a future champion with wins over Stephane Robert, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Vesely and Nadal.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

live, with the page’s objective to track down and let commuters know where officers are on trains.\n\nThe group has amassed a following of 2,500 members since its inception.\n\nThe group has been created the same week as a grace period comes to an end on stricter rules surrounding the use of public transport for students.\n\nFull-time students who claim concession rates are now required to travel with a tertiary transport concession card (TTCC).\n\nPage creator and full-time university student PJ said the group was a necessity because there is a large amount of students who have not received their TTCC.\n\n“Students were pointing out that they still had not received their cards due to the backlog, students were in fear and at crossroads of either receiving fines or having to budget half of their finances for full fare travel,” PJ said.\n\nPJ said he was not surprised by the popularity of the page and said there was a lot of “furious” students over the implementation of the TTCC and the high fare prices of Brisbane public transport.\n\n“To protect themselves from fines they (students) are resorting to our page to keep ahead of authorities,” he said.\n\n“TransLink and the transport minister should provide an amnesty to students, who despite applying for the TTCC months ago, have yet to receive their cards.”\n\nAlthough the page may seem like it is built for fare dodgers and those looking for a free ride, PJ insists that isn’t quite right.\n\n“Fare dodging isn’t quite the term; it’s simply there to protect the students who have been caught up in a bureaucratic bungle with the botched implementation of the TTCC.”\n\nTransLink said anyone caught rorting public transport can expect to receive a $227 fine.\n\n“Safety is our top priority and our officers are intentionally highly visible on the TransLink network to act as a deterrent to anti-social or other illegal behaviour and so protect the public, TransLink said.\n\n“They are constantly moving across all of our bus and train routes to ensure customer safety and to target fare evasion across the entire network.”\n\nTransLink said most offences on the network occur in the busiest stations, such as Roma St, Beenleigh and South Bank train stations and Cultural Centre, Brisbane CBD and Southport for buses.\n\n","byline":"Chris McMahon

features the iPhone 6 will offer.\n\nWith the new device expected to be launched in two months, news.com.au has pulled together the best early indications of what to expect with the new model.\n\nAlthough Apple hasn’t confirmed any of these rumours, leaked images suggest these are the most likely features.\n\nHere’s what to expect from the iPhone 6.\n\n1. Super-size me\n\nThe most prevalent rumour about the new iPhone 6 is that Apple will, in fact, release two versions of the smartphone. There is set to be two different-sized models to be launched at the same time: a standard 4.7-inch model and an oversized 5.5-inch. The larger version is expected to be $100 more expensive but offer a better camera and a higher storage capacity.\n\n2. More brain power\n\nThe larger iPhone could have up to 128GB in storage capacity, according to Mac Rumours. Tech site 9to5Mac reports that the smaller version is expected to be released with 32GB and 64GB storage options.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nA larger body means a larger screen. As we reported early in the week, Australian market research firm Telsyte has found that Apple could lose almost half its potential iPhone 6 customer base if it simply pumped out another smartphone with roughly the same screen size. So it’s pleasing to hear the customers will have the choice of a 4.7-inch or a 5.5-inch display, which eclipses the iPhone 5S’s four inches. This will allow the iPhone 6 to better compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches), Sony Xperia Z2 (5.2 inches), LG G3 (5.5 inches) and Nokia Lumia 930 Windows 8 (5 inches). The screen could also go virtually to the edges of the phone for the first time.\n\niPhone 6 leak: metal case reveals same new #iPhone #design lines - http://t.co/3tL468vYfg pic.twitter.com/E6HKn3YLLs\n\n— HiddenRadio (@HiddenRadio) July 2, 2014 \n\n4. This baby’s got curves\n\nThe new model is likely to do away with the flat edges on the iPhone 4 and 5 and adopt a more curvaceous body. Expect a rounder design with curved edges.\n\n5. Slimline \n\nThe body of the phone is also expected to be much thinner than the iPhone 5S and more closely resemble the iPod touch. The slimline design is also expected to result in a lighter device.\n\n6. Glossy \n\nLeaked photographs show that the screen and body has a sleek, glossy finish. There are also rumours that the screen will be made of sapphire crystal, which will make it more resistant to scratches.\n\n7. What shall I call thee?\n\nThe new model is believed to be called the iPhone Air.\n\n8. Snap happy\n\nThe iPhone 6 is expected to have a better camera with more megapixels so it can better compete with its rivals. The phone is also likely to have superior image stabilisation, which helps users take clearer pictures while moving.\n\n9.

it is normal behaviour.\n\n“This dive took place about one week prior to the tag recording the higher temperatures (not immediately before as some have reported) and the two events are not related.\n\n“We have seen white sharks biting each other before, sometimes removing pieces of tissue in the process.\n\n“One shark bit off a little more than he could chew and ended up swallowing the tag.”\n\nCSIRO has one of the most comprehensive white shark research programs in the world, with over 250 tagged in Australian waters.\n\n","byline":"AAP ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/western-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"perthnow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T07:18:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T07:19:37.000Z","description":"PERSISTENT speculation that a colossal sea predator may have devoured a nine-foot white shark in waters off WA’s south has been debunked.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5tho-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5thq-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5thn-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5thm-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnhocxo3-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5thp-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"1d2ba45fe3271c96cf4196f11215fe72","keywords":["comprehensive white","Australian waters","nine-foot white","Western Australia","CSIRO","shark","white sharks","core body temperature","tag recording","killer whale","media reports","tracking device","myth","debunked","Esperance"],"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/speculation-of-a-colossal-sea-predator-off-wa-debunked-by-csiro/story-fnii5thp-1226975464438?sv=6b832969bcb9520af72d28eaf33206e1","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975464438","originalSource":"AAP","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"dcb47dbfecf75cf64d4eb70cbf3c6b0e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975464387","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"PERSISTENT speculation that a colossal sea predator may have devoured a nine-foot white shark off WA has been debunked.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Speculation of a colossal sea predator off WA debunked by CSIRO","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"WA ‘super predator’ myth debunked","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"a932f002-01b8-11e4-8a13-c9890f82f8cd -

workers of the decision on Wednesday.\n\nIt will mean the loss of 27 operational and office-based jobs as well as 25 casual and labouring staff.\n\nForgacs CEO Lindsay Stratton attributed the closure to the high Australian dollar and low costs of competing Asian shipyards.\n\n“We have tried hard to avoid this outcome but cannot ignore the fact that our ­financial forecast and trading experience both confirm the closure of the site is the only option,” Mr Stratton said.\n\nBut for employees such as third-generation mechanical fitter Robert Proctor (pictured), this has done little to ease the pain of losing a job.\n\n“I’ll try to find some work as soon as possible because I have a wife and a 20-month-old little girl,” Mr Proctor said. “We are a fairly young workforce so there are a lot of wives and kids and mortgages that need to be looked after.”\n\nMr Proctor worked at Forgacs for more than eight years and said the mood at yesterday’s meeting was sombre.\n\n“We were also a bit relieved because it has been hanging over our heads for a while,” he said.\n\n“It’s sad to see 70 years of ship repair at this site finished.”\n\nJust five years ago Forgacs, Australia’s largest privately owned shipbuilding and repair company, employed more than 200 permanent staff at the 15ha shipyard site, working to restore large cruise liners such as the P & O cruise ship ­Pacific Dawn.\n\nWhile the closure of the shipyard won’t impact Forgacs engineering operations in Gladstone, Garden Island in Sydney and Newcastle, the ship has sailed on the Brisbane site for good.\n\nAs the city’s second dock, the Cairncross site was constructed in 1942 and officially opened two years later.\n\nThe site was taken over by Keppel in 1994 and then purchased by Forgacs in 1999.\n\nA spokesperson for Forgacs told The Courier-Mail operations had been slow for the past five years.\n\nFederal MP for Griffith, Terri Butler, whose electorate covers the dockyard, tweeted that it was a “sad end for a significant site”.\n\nIf you know more contact: rhian.deutrom@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"Rhian Deutrom

But boganism is a culture. These guys are unashamedly bogans. They love it, they live it, they have a complete lack of any pretence. I reckon the bogan is the true Aussie battler of the new millennium.”\n\nAnd while they are all unique in their embracement of the “culture”, they all have one thing in common. \n\n“It’s a mystery, the teeth of the bogan,” added Fenech, “a bit like the Bermuda Triangle. Could be too many Beam and Cokes, I don’t know. But I would say more than 50 per cent of bogans do have some pretty interesting teeth, that’s for sure. It could be a money thing. It costs a lot to get your teeth fixed.”\n\nHe says the finalists are defined by: “Mullets, thongs, ugg boots, flannelettes, tight jeans, a love of Oz rock, home done tattoos are important, a lack of pretence is very important, as is a willingness to be incredibly honest at all time.”\n\nAustralia, meet your finalists:\n\nMEL: the kinky chick from Munno Para, South Australia \n\nSaid to perfectly represent the “female of the bogan species”. She once stabbed her partner in the neck with a pair of scissors because he poked her too much in the arm.\n\nANDREW: the dad to eight kids to three different mothers from Bridgewater, Tasmania \n\nHas the name of his eight kids tattooed on his arms, all the girls on one arm and the boys on the other. “I can’t remember their dates of birth cos I’m always too smashed. That way if I go to Centrelink and they ask me, well I can say ‘here we go, here’s the date of birth” he said as he showed off the ink.\n\nDARREN: the second worst driver in Tasmania, also from Bridgewater \n\nHas 52 charges of driving with no licence against his name and is proud of it. Has his own car graveyard full off abandoned wrecks. “What more do you want in life,” he said.\n\nNANNA SHAZZA: the larger-than-life GILF from Victoria’s bogan epicentre, Nar Nar Goon \n\nIs the “odds on favourite” to win. Loves her Holdens, Collingwood football team and exposing her breasts. Enjoys drinking a goon sack of wine hung from a clothesline.\n\nJUSTIN: the young chick magnet from St Helens, Tasmania \n\nIs the youngest bogan of the finalists. Sports a good array of tatts including an “Made in Australia” sign, a Southern Cross and the name of his son across his chest. Became a dad at 16 and is fiercely proud of his mullet which he describes as “nice and filthy”.\n\nFORDY: the wild man from Rocky aka Western Australia’s most bogan suburb, Rockingham \n\nCan swear mid-word, loves a nudie run, Ned Kelly, a barbecue and has an esky of beers kept next to his bed. Attempted to eat the rubber remnants left on the ground after a burnout.\n\nCLINT: the 50-something bogan “lifer” from George Town, Tasmania \n\nJudges said he “ticked so many bogan boxes”. Talked about his favourite sex position, doggie style, showed off his missus’ homemade tattoos and has an incredible collection of bogan friends.

witness in the trial is psychiatrist Dr Mark Schramm.\n\nHe said he worked chiefly in forensic psychiatry, including in the prison mental health service, but also worked privately.\n\nDr Schramm said he looked at Allison Baden-Clay’s autopsy report, doctor records, as well as psychology consultation notes and records.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay was first diagnosed with relapsing major depression disorder, with features of anxiety, by Dr Tom George in 2003.\n\nDr Schramm said that meant it had a longitudinal course that waxed, waned and recurred upon one of her pregnancies.\n\n“It wasn’t just a single episode it was more than one episode,” he said.\n\nHe said the symptoms of the disorder included a depressed mood, self-doubt, anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nDr Schramm said there was a link between major depression and suicide.\n\n“Studies for the rate of suicide vary … but probably one of the most well-respected studies performed by people who work in Australia or even Brisbane suggests that 3.4 per cent of people who experience depression will take their lives,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not universal for people who took their own lives to leave a note.\n\n“More than half do not,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for suicide to be a surprise to loved ones, friends and relatives.\n\n“It is also the case that very often, and unfortunately suicide is a surprise, and even in retrospect it has been impossible to predict,” he said.\n\nKEEP READING BELOW FOR FULL COVERAGE FROM DAY 14 OF THE BADEN-CLAY TRIAL\n\nDr Schramm said around half of those who ended their lives had seen a medical professional in the two weeks prior.\n\n“I think it’s folly to assume that simply because you have a medical degree or you are a psychologist or a psychiatrist that you can confidently predict or rule out when someone might kill themselves,” he said.\n\n“It’s human nature to assume that experts have the answers.”\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for experts to “miss” someone who was at risk.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Danny Boyle, Dr Schramm agreed he had not interviewed anyone in relation to his assessment.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests

opinions were based on medical notes and records.\n\nDr Schramm agreed his remarks were general and related to people who suffered depression.\n\nHe asked the psychiatrist about maternal attachment.\n\n“If someone has a strong attachment to her children and she has a concern as to their wellbeing, an ongoing concern, that would indicate a high level of attachment which would be a protective factor against suicide?” Mr Boyle said.\n\nDr Schramm said it would reduce the risk Ms Baden-Clay would harm herself.\n\n“I accept that is something that goes against the argument that she was suicidal,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked if suicide was likely if there had been no triggering event.\n\n“I’d suggest there could be some triggering events that we don’t know about, some triggering events that are internal, but I accept that knowing there is no triggering event … it is less likely,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed a person making short and long-term plans would make one “less concerned” they would harm themselves.\n\n“A decision may have occurred after such plans, long term or medium term, were made,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked about the likely suicide risk of a person who had been proactive in the past about seeking assistance from counsellors and doctors.\n\n“In general I would accept Allison seemed to be someone who put her hand up when she wasn’t coping and sought help,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed symptoms of depression could become worse during pregnancy.\n\nHe agreed doctors could increase an anti-depressant dose in order to control mood swings around menstruation.\n\nDr Schramm said he did not know when Ms Baden-Clay was last actively depressed.\n\n“The records show one of her most recent attendances on her GP at the Kenmore clinic, which was sometime in March, indicated she was complaining of mood swings,” he said.\n\nHe said he noticed a note in Ms Baden-Clay’s session with Carmel Ritchie in which she spoke of feeling “not good enough”.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne, Dr Schramm said it was not his belief the increase of sertraline dosage would be likely to have caused suicidal ideation.\n\n“You would normally expect that increased risk when someone first starts on that medication,” he said.\n\nHe added that depression was a factor for suicide.\n\nDr Schramm agreed he noted Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing possibly depressive cognitions at an appointment with counsellor Carmel Ritchie.\n\n“When people are depressed they look at life through grey-coloured glasses … they evaluate situations themselves in a more negative light through grey glasses. That often is associated with feelings of guilt and inadequacy and I appreciate it is simply cherry-picking one statement, but that struck me as something that may well have been said by someone who is depressed,” he said.\n\n“It may also represent the words of someone who may have as part of their personality, had some self-doubt.\n\n“I don’t think we should draw great certainty from one statement like that but that is certainly not inconsistent with someone who is depressed.”\n\nDr Schramm said Ms Baden-Clay’s visit to a doctor to treat mood swings around menstruation on March 19, 2012 were not “inconsistent” with depression.\n\n“It’s not inconsistent with it, that’s all I can say. It’s consistent with the GP assessing that she was depressed,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed the notes of Ms Baden-Clay’s doctor in 2011, which revealed Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing guilt, low mood and tears.\n\n“They all signify a high chance that she was relapsing in her depressive illness,” he said.\n\nThe defence closed its case.\n\nJustice John Byrne told the jury all the evidence to be put before them in the trial had been presented.\n\nHe said lawyers’ addresses to the jury would begin on Monday, first with defence counsel Mr Byrne and followed by an address from prosecutor Mr Fuller.\n\nJustice Byrne said he would then sum up the case to the jury and they would retire to consider a verdict.\n\nThe trial was adjourned until 10am Monday.\n\n12.45pm: The 74th witness in the trial is forensic toxicologist Dr Michael Robertson.\n\nHe said he had been a forensic toxicologist for 20 years and had studied widely in his field.\n\nDr Robertson said he did a toxicological examination of the results obtained from Allison Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said the review was of Ms Baden-Clay’s post mortem results and the levels of a particular drug, called sertraline.\n\n“Sertaline is the active drug within the commercial or trade name medication Zoloft,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said it was an anti-depressant and elevated levels of serotonin in the brain, or mood-elevating chemicals, to reduce depression\n\nHe said sertraline was a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI), which increased levels of serotonin in the brain.\n\nHe said the drug would be broken down and metabolised into desmethyl sertraline.\n\nDr Robertson said the levels of sertraline in the blood of Ms Baden-CLay was .59mg/kg and levels of desmethyl sertraline were at 3.3mg/kg.\n\nHe said there was also some detected in the stomach and liver, at 5mg/kg and desmethly sertraline of 31mg/kg.\n\nDr Robertson said it was unusual for levels to be above 0.05mg/kg in a person.\n\nHe said average numbers he expected in a living person taking sertraline was 0.03mg/kg.\n\nHe said Ms Baden-Clay’s levels were elevated.\n\nDr Robertson said drug concentrations in the body usually altered after death, a phenomenon known as “post-mortem redistribution”.\n\nHe said studies showed sertraline redistribution usually did not change too much after death but tended towards being slightly higher.\n\nHe said elevated levels could be caused by the ingestion of a different amount of drug to the recommended therapeutic amount.\n\n“It might be there is an unusual amount of redistribution in this case, some level of contamination may have occurred during the post-mortem,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said there were a number of side-effects for sertraline, including common adverse effects such as anxiety, agitation, confusion, thermo-regulation or an elevation of temperature, and even serotonin syndrome or toxicity.\n\n“This is a well described adverse event that involves unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said serotonin effects varied from individual to individual.\n\nDr Robertson said serotonin syndrome occurred when levels were too high and started to affect other areas of the brain.\n\n“When you get too much of this drug you can get situations again where more profound confusion might exist in a general way, increased agitation, unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said studies showed individuals who were taking “SSRIs” were more likely to experience suicidal ideation.\n\n“The mechanism behind that is simply unclear … it usually happens when someone first starts to take medication or alters medication, those sort of things,” he said.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Dr Robertson agreed trace levels of serotonin in the stomach may have been transferred there after death.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay would not be described as a “naïve” patient as she had been on Zoloft since 2003.\n\nDr Robertson agreed she would have likely developed a tolerance to the drug.\n\nHe agreed redistribution of drugs in the body meant levels in the extremities, such as a leg, would not increase as much as drug concentrations in the centre of the body.\n\n“The theory being if significant post-mortem redistribution takes place, the concentration in the central blood should have increased … more than it would in the peripheral blood,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson agreed drug concentration levels depended on time, the position of the body and leeching of fat from the body.\n\nHe said the liver would break down sertraline.\n\nHe agreed the fact the blood sample was from the liver was a factor in interpreting the concentration levels.\n\nDr Robertson agreed sertraline was usually reported as a multi-drug cause of death, rather than a drug alone.\n\nHe agreed the levels of serotonin in the blood were not consistent with an overdose causing death.\n\n“I would agree they are not necessarily consistent with those numbers,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said he could not say the serotonin levels were inconsistent with causing death.\n\n“I can’t necessarily agree with that completely as I can’t explain the elevated drug concentrations completely, they might have been elevated for some reason … whether they indirectly had some involvement, I don’t know,” he said.\n\nIn re-examination by Mr Byrne, Dr Robertson said serotonin syndrome could occur in a regular user when the dose was increased.\n\n12.05pm: The 73rd witness in the trial is Ashton Ward who is the manager of a company called “Khemistry”.\n\nHe was called to give evidence by barrister Michael Byrne QC, for Gerard Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said he did time-lapse recordings of the tidal movements at the Kholo Creek Bridge between June 12, 2014 and June 22, 2014.\n\nMr Ward said the film was still images that were converted into a time-lapse video.\n\nHe said the camera was set to take a photo image every 2 minutes during daylight hours.\n\nHe said that was switched to once every three minutes on June 18, 2014.\n\nThe time-lapse videos were played to the jury, one a closer view than the other.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Mr Ward agreed the photos were initially taken every two minutes, so that one second equalled 50 minutes.\n\nHe said when it was changed to take one photo every three minutes, it became one second to every 75 minutes.\n\nMr Ward agreed he did not know what the area looked like in 2012.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay

Fuller QC he went to see doctors on the advice of his lawyers.\n\nHe agreed police took photos of him on April 21, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could not remember telling police about the injuries on his torso.\n\nHe agreed people were concerned about the marks on his cheek.\n\n“When you say concerned, yeah, they kept saying that they had a concern so that concerned me so I told them what it was,” he said.\n\nHe said the injuries on his torso were “self-inflicted” and “just didn’t seem relevant”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he went to another doctor on the afternoon of April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he gave one of the doctors his business card and offered to give her assistance moving to the area.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused about the deed of variation he signed in order to obtain the rent roll in late 2011.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he would suffer a significant financial loss and return to owning just a quarter share in the rent roll business, if he defaulted on the variation.\n\nMr Fuller suggested the loss the accused would incur for defaulting on the rent roll variation was $46,800.\n\nHe asked Baden-Clay what loss he would incur if his wife left him.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife was not paid a salary.\n\nHe agreed they had an investment property together, shares and an investment property.\n\nMr Fuller said couple had a net assets worth of $74,663.\n\n“You are asking an awful lot of hypothetical questions that I … I honestly can’t answer that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed there would have been financial consequences for him if he separated from his wife.\n\n“If Allison and I had determined we were doing to separate, divorce or something like that, how that played out, I honestly don’t know,” he said.\n\n“I can’t now remember exactly why I told her that but it seemed to placate her at that time.”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he faced pressures on April 19, 2012 but they were “not significant”.\n\n“You put to me yesterday that Allison required certain things of me, including that I not go out at night, that I hand my phone to her, that I put that find friends application on my phone and I should clarify … I felt satisfied I had answered truthfully and factually answered all the questions you asked … it was actually my suggestion to load that application on our phones,” he said.\n\nThe accused said both he and his wife knew how to turn it off.\n\n“And on the one day I needed it, it failed me, that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller said the app didn’t stop the accused from meeting Toni McHugh or contacting her regularly.\n\n“That is correct. Predominantly instigated by Toni, but yes that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller suggested Baden-Clay wanted to be with Ms McHugh.\n\n“Allison and I had recommenced our physical relationship that year and as I mentioned yesterday Allison and I had gone for around 9 years … yes, there were a number of women I went to for sex around that period … but Allison and I were rebuilding,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he was betraying his wife’s trust and continuing to do so on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I suggest to you Toni McHugh offered you a different life and you wanted to take that opportunity?,” Mr Fuller asked.\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, that’s not correct.”\n\nThe accused said he was “very ashamed” by his infidelity and wanted to put it behind him to move forward with his wife.\n\n“I did not feel that,” he said, of Ms McHugh and his wife meeting at the real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was “placating” Ms McHugh when he told her he loved her.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused if he would be exposed if his wife met Ms McHugh at the conference.\n\nHe argued she would find out about his affairs, the emails and the fact they had met for sex again since her discovery of the affair in September, 2011.\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed your wife, Mr Baden-Clay?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed her either in or at your house at Brookfield that night or in the early hours of the morning?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You attacked her and the only way she could respond was to lash out and claw at your face and leave marks upon it?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller: “Probably as you smothered her and took her life from her?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller suggested his wife grabbed at his clothing, causing marks under his arm.\n\nMr Fuller: “You overpowered her pretty quickly, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “I never overpowered her at all … I never did anything to physically harm my wife in any way, ever, so your supposition and to take it further to suggest I did other things is absurd and I object to it. So I can’t answer your question.”\n\nHe said he did not know if his wife’s head came into contact with leaves in their backyard.\n\n“I did not have anything to do with anything that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked if he put his wife into the back of their Holden Captiva.\n\n“I had nothing to do with anything that you are asking me,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not dump his wife’s body off Kholo Creek Bridge.\n\n“The suggestion that I would leave my children for any time in the middle of the night is absurd, let alone to do the dastardly things that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nHe said he did not put his phone on charge at 1.48am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not shave over the scratch marks on his face.\n\n“I did not,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he let police to search his home.\n\n“I had nothing to hide,” he said.\n\n“I was a concerned husband and I’m a very concerned father, I remain so. It is not a facade.”\n\nThe accused agreed he took legal advice and did not give a formal statement to police.\n\n“My lawyer insisted upon it and so I followed that advice,” he said.\n\nHe said he never told his wife on the night she disappeared that she would run into Ms McHugh the next day.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne QC, Baden-Clay reiterated he was never violent towards his wife on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I’ve never thrown a punch in my life in anger,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he and his wife had disagreed during their marriage but never by being disrespectful to one another.\n\nHe said he did not hear any noises that night.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not deceive his wife about anything other than his infidelity over the four years before her death.\n\nHe said he did not deceive his family and friends about anything else apart from his infidelity.\n\n“Deceive is a strong word but I protected Allison in relation to the extent of her depression, which we didn’t really know much about in the early years and Allison was very, very conscious that she really didn’t want anybody to know that she suffered from any mental illness so, certainly I protected Allison and didn’t tell any friends and family about her mental illness,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he deceived Ms McHugh by telling her there was a possibility they had a future together.\n\nHe said he was relieved when his wife discovered his affair with Ms McHugh but he did not tell her about other women he met for sex.\n\n“I had no intention of telling Allison about the other women.\n\n“I didn’t want to jeopardise any chance we had of making a future together, further, it was purely about the physical aspect that I went to those other women … over an extended period of time, admittedly,” he said.\n\nThe accused said there were occasions when he questioned whether it was beneficial for his wife to know intimate details of his affair with Ms McHugh.\n\nHe said counsellors told them it would be helpful for his wife to have her questions answered, but in his experience, it did not seem to be helpful to her.\n\nBaden-Clay said counsellor Carmel Ritchie put structure into those conversations and he felt more confident about having those discussions with his wife.\n\nHe said Ms McHugh did not stay at his house, but rather visited.\n\n“We’d had some physical intimacy at the house, I had told Allison about that, on one occasion she had a spare room at that point and there was a spare bed and we no longer had that … and a spare mattress,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he was concerned Ms McHugh was not coping very well and he wanted her to have the strength to get on with her life and find someone else.\n\n“In retrospect, looking at some of the things I said and did, it was pretty naïve and pretty stupid, but that was my intention,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told Ms McHugh he did not want to be intimate with her until he was out of the marriage with his wife.\n\n“I felt stronger and more confident I would be able to maintain the distance if we weren’t seeing each other,” he said.\n\nHe said he hoped they would one day be friends.\n\n“I wanted to make sure we just had no physical relationship with each other at all,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed it was not a concern for him the two women in his life – mistress and wife - would meet at a real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said it was not in his wife’s nature to be confrontational or to “cause a scene”.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought his wife would have anticipated Ms McHugh would have been there, anyway, adding that she had colleague Kate Rankin with her.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh had a volatile personality but in a public environment, was “always able to control herself”.\n\n“I really had no concern at all,” he said.\n\nThe jury was shown a page from his wife’s journal.\n\nIn it was written: “I don’t want to be alone. I am afraid of being alone and lonely maybe because I think I can’t handle it. I am afraid of failing – failing in my marriage and what people would think.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why his wife had written such a thing but believed it to be her handwriting.\n\nThe trial will resume at 11.50am.\n\n10.45am: The jury will today hear continued cross-examination of the accused by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC.\n\nIt will be Gerard Baden-Clay’s fourth day in the witness box.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused whether he thought his wife may have had contact with his mistress Toni McHugh on April 19, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not think so.\n\nHe agreed his wife had his phone that night and Ms McHugh could have contacted him.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed his mistress knew where he lived.\n\nHe said he did not remember Ms McHugh telling him that not going to the conference on April 20, 2012 was not an option.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought it was “probable” Ms McHugh would not call him after hours.\n\n“By the end of the conversation she had calmed down a fair bit,” he said of a heated discussion with Ms McHugh in the late afternoon of April 19, 2012.\n\nHe said he did not tell police about his dealings with Ms McHugh on that day.\n\nThe accused said he did not tell his family about the affair until he was told by a journalist it would be disclosed in a story.\n\nBaden-Clay said he told the police.\n\n“I didn’t anticipate the police were going to inform the media, but they did,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he spoke to police at the Brookfield Showgrounds on April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he spoke to police on numerous occasions over those days and “answered every and any question they asked me”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he did not make a formal statement.\n\n“That was the only thing that they asked me and I told them and had a lengthy conversation with (Sgt) Chris Canniffe … I pleaded with him and said I’ve been given legal advice and said what would you do in my position and it was Mr Canniffe who calmed the situation,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he wasn’t sure what CIB stood for or what a crime scene was.\n\n“I believe there were a couple of police I spoke to who were from the homicide,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he first met Sen-Sgt Narelle Curtis during a siege situation involving a cult at a property at Anstead.\n\n“I think Narelle may have been the officer in charge when that all occurred,” he said.\n\nHe agreed that was a positive dealing.\n\nBaden-Clay said he occasionally attended meetings with a Kenmore Police consulting committee.\n\nHe said police were “probably” in contact with him every day following his wife’s disappearance.\n\nThe accused said Sgt Canniffe was at first, very responsive, but as the days passed took longer to reply to phone calls.\n\n“I was very concerned about the whereabouts of my wife and often one communication and one text message a day was not enough for me, I desperately wanted to know what was going on,” he said.\n\nHe said he first spoke to his lawyer around midday on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said he met his lawyer at a Yatala service station complex midway between his office on the Gold Coast and Brookfield that night.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed the first call he made to his wife was at 6.32am.\n\nHe said he thought he sent her a text message before that but it was not recorded on the summary provided to the court.\n\n“I don’t know why,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he phoned his family at 6.44am.\n\n“My initial call was just to say have you heard from her or anything and in that conversation … they came over and helped,” he said.\n\nThe accused agreed he did not call his wife’s friends Kerry-Anne Walker or Wendy Mollah, in part because they lived too far away and he did not have Ms Mollah’s number at that time.\n\nHe said he did not get through to his parent’s house at Kenmore until 6.46am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he took the Holden Captiva to look for his wife because his Prado had been in a car crash on Monday April 16, 2012.\n\nHe agreed his car, the Prado, was parked closer to the driveway.\n\nHe further agreed the Captiva had been parked nose-in to the car port.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he had driven the Prado all week despite the accidents, just not on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said the car was not reversed into the car port when he got up that day.\n\nThe jury was shown a photo of Baden-Clay’s damaged Prado, which was side-swiped on the Monday before his wife went missing, parked in front of his wife’s car parked behind it in the car port.\n\n“There was nothing to stop me taking the Prado,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he first noticed the toys in the back of the Holden Captiva the morning his wife went missing.\n\nHe said it was not a “total surprise” to him they were in the car.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not put the toys in the back of the car.\n\nMr Fuller: “You didn’t move them there to make it look … normal, or a semblance of normal?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not put them there.”\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents at 9.30am.\n\n“I thought that she’d gone for a walk I called them later on when the police were there,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he called them after he was “interrogated” by police for a couple of hours.\n\nMr Fuller: “But you called your friends first, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he called his closest friends before he called his wife’s closest friends, Ms Walker and Ms Mollah.\n\nHe said police did not prevent him from making calls on April 20, 2012.\n\nThe accused agreed police let him call his children’s school and take a call from the president of the P&C.\n\nHe agreed police were supportive of him with respect to his children and his dealings with the school.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was not concerned by the line of questioning from police, not like his father or his sister.\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents as soon as he could.\n\n“I couldn’t see, my informing them was not necessarily for them to drop everything and come up, obviously that’s a natural reaction and that’s what they did,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not call Ms McHugh, either.\n\nHe agreed his wife was at least an hour overdue by 8am.\n\nThe accused agreed it was “completely out of character” for his wife to be late to meet a colleague, such as Kate Rankin, or an appointment.\n\n“I didn’t ring her parents until there was an opportunity to do so,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused again why he rang his friends before he phoned his wife’s friends.\n\n“I called the Christs because we had plans for a sleepover that evening … I wanted them to be aware that Allison was missing and I wanted to ask if they had seen anything, I didn’t think that she would have walked to their house … we didn’t have any close friends … but I just didn’t think it was likely,” he said.\n\n“I anticipated she was coming home any minute but I was concerned about what was going to happen in the afternoon.\n\n“If Allison was in hospital and we found her, that would obviously throw all the plans…”\n\nHe said he called the Cheesmans because their home was going on sale that day and he was going to put some finishing touches on the property that day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he asked his father to go in his stead, but he was prevented from doing so by the police.\n\n“I was concerned about my wife but I obviously had my family and my business that was operating as well,” he said.\n\nHe agreed an employee took over the Cheesmans open house the next day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why he called his friend Peter Cranna that day, then added it was because he lived close by.\n\nHe agreed he and his wife had significant insurance policies.\n\nBaden-Clay said they had discussed reducing them because the premiums were high.\n\nHe agreed he contacted an insurance agency on May 1, 2012 about making a claim, at his father’s behest.\n\nThe accused said he was at his office when a media report came through on April 30, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he went to Brisbane city and met his lawyer and barrister Peter Davis in his chambers.\n\nHe agreed police told him a body had been found.\n\n“They confirmed it was Allison,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller: “Are you confident of that?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Yes, because we knew a body had been found and it was at that meeting they told us they were sure it was Allison. I remember being physically shocked by that.”\n\n10am: Gerard Baden-Clay will face more cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller today.\n\nThere is a short delay for legal discussion, the trial will begin when the jury enters the court.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nYesterday, the court heard that for four years Gerard Baden-Clay deceived everyone – his wife, his lover, his friends and family.\n\nHe lied to his wife when he told her his affair was over. He lied to his lover when he told her he would walk out on his marriage.\n\nHe deceived his friends and family when he told them he was happily married, that all was well in his relationship with his wife.\n\nUnder a fast-paced cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller, Gerard Baden-Clay admitted that for years he lived a double life, lying constantly to those closest to him.\n\nBaden-Clay told a Supreme Court jury he deceived his wife Allison about his affairs with three different women and continued to see his mistress Toni McHugh even after she found out about his infidelity.\n\nHe said he repeatedly told Ms McHugh he loved her to “placate her’’ and her volatile personality but didn’t tell Allison she and his mistress would be attending the same conference because there was “no risk’’ Ms McHugh would do anything rash.\n\n“There were a number of occasions when you had to say things to avoid the consequences of your actions during these couple of years, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller asked Baden-Clay during the accused murderer’s third day on the stand.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct.\n\nTweets by @TheMurrayD \n\n“You deceived your family and friends for that four year period as well, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller pressed.\n\n“Led them to believe you were happily married … that everything was good within your relationship with your wife.’’\n\nBaden-Clay agreed.\n\n“That you were a success, that your business was going well – and that was what was most important to you, wasn’t it? What people saw of you.’’\n\n“I wouldn’t say that,’’ Baden-Clay replied.\n\nBaden-Clay also told the court it meant nothing that he chose his wife’s birthday as the date he would walk out of his marriage in an email to his lover.\n\n“You went on to give her a date when you would be together, the 1st of July … which just happened to be your wife’s birthday,’’ Mr Fuller asked, referring to the email Baden-Clay sent Ms McHugh on April 3, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct, adding “which also happens to be today’’.\n\n“But you didn’t think about that when you sent that email, that was just coincidence, was it?’’ Mr Fuller said. Baden-Clay replied: “It was.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had sent that email as his wife worked to rebuild their damaged relationship, including finding them a marriage counsellor. “And behind her back, this is the message you are sending to Toni McHugh,’’ he said.\n\nBaden-Clay faltered when Mr Fuller asked him the first time he’d told his wife he didn’t love her.\n\n“The conversations that we had were, please forgive me, I’m just trying to recollect for you … I’m trying to see if I can think if I can give a reference in time,’’ Baden-Clay said.\n\n“I think it must have been in 2009, perhaps when we first went to see (psychologist Dr Tom George) and we had a few conversations around then.\n\n“We agreed to go together and it was after conversations with Dr George that we had further discussions with Allison that I (said I) still loved her but I didn’t feel ‘in love’ with her.’’\n\nHe was also pressed on a list of questions Allison had written in her journal to ask Gerard during one of their 15 minute “talks’’ recommended by marriage counsellor Carmel Ritchie in the days before she disappeared.\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay lied when he claimed their talk had been on April 18, instead of April 19 as he’d initially indicated to police.\n\nBaden-Clay insisted Allison had asked him the questions from her journal on April 18. He said he didn’t know why she’d written “why so mean’’. “I don’t know and if she had been able to ask me that question she would have been able to expand upon that,” he said.\n\nThe trial continues today.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Baskin, Kate Kyriacou ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T04:32:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:33:24.000Z","description":"IT is day 14 of the trial of former Brookfield real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, who stands accused of murdering his wife Allison Baden-Clay, 43, on April 19, 2012.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v71-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v70-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6y-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6u-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"71b9788dda62a499b3666ccde095a5e8","keywords":["accused murderer","marriage counsellor","double life","fast-paced cross examination","Murder accused","damaged relationship","Allison Baden-Clay","volatile personality","life insurance","Digital manipulation","multiple affairs","four-year period","fast-paced prosecution cross-examination","Brisbane","Queensland","Australia","Supreme Court","Todd Fuller","Toni McHugh","Carmel Ritchie","Kate Kyriacou"],"kicker":"’Elevated levels’","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974352079","originalAssetId":"1226974352079","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"f5320252a2bbe17c3551c675e6a182cd","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"9jZDdrbjpJnFSrI0N-jePXucmY0Jn06x","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"2c3ec8e8443e2498892462cc80bbbe15","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"0wM2Zrbjr_2IG7bczHuuhP2XJ18zd2LR","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f174c0b74973890268cb07f312992d3d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974349919","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58d6ea842e84273d6251a12f62cf214a","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"BteG9qbjpjXJKSWDj3BAbjoY_c0foFfK","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58c6342cb22789a6a4985b76c372a53e","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"F0aDBrbjpB3aP0WhQmgL_FovtRXrMFzB","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"ee6d7eaad7142f94c449f56eac2d8e61","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"ZmcmlrbjoAkw1AYzzBjIIkHPLI0SMD4g","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A FORENSIC toxicologist says he found “elevated levels” of a drug in Allison Baden-Clay’s system - a drug with side effects that involve “unusual behaviours”.

His family are in a position to ensure his safety.\n\n“His family are not concerned for his safety, and I submit that that’s a significant factor given that they live on the island – they’re in a better position to raise concerns than anyone.\n\n“They also have more of a vested interest in the safety of their child than anyone.”\n\nSince his arrest, the boy has also been charged with vandalism inside Cleveland Youth Detention Centre.\n\n","byline":"EMMA CHANNON","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and

director, Nick Cassavetes revealed that the animosity between the pair was so great that during filming Gosling tried to get his female co-star sacked.\n\nBut they’re not the only co-stars who have clashed off-screen.\n\nHere are seven famous examples.\n\nPierce Brosnan v Teri Hatcher: Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)\n\nPierce Brosnan has openly admitted that he struggled to form a bond (pun intended) with his female co-star.\n\n“I got very upset with her,” Brosnan told the Daily Mirror. “She was always keeping me waiting for hours. I must admit I let slip a few words which weren’t very nice.”\n\nBill Murray v Lucy Liu: Charlie’s Angels (2000)\n\nRumour has it that Bill Murray stopped a scene purely to tell Lucy Liu that she couldn’t act. Not surprisingly, Liu did not take it well. In fact she reportedly threw a punch at the Groundhog Day star.\n\nWhen asked about the onset spat, Murray told the New York Times, “Look, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me.\n\n“When our relationship is professional, and you’re not getting that done, forget it.”\n\nIn the years since, Murray appears to have moved on, saying, “I feel very warmly for her (Liu) now”.\n\nKenny Baker (R2D2) v Anthony Daniels (C3PO): Star Wars (1977)\n\nRobots aren’t meant to have feelings, but Kenny Baker certainly did after working with Anthony Daniels on Star Wars.\n\n“Anthony doesn’t mix at all — he keeps himself to himself,” Baker said.\n\n“He never wants to have a drink with any of us. Once when I said hello to him he just turned his back on me and said, ‘Can’t you see I’m having a conversation?’ I was blazing with rage.\n\n“It was the rudest thing anyone had ever done to me. I was furious. It was unbelievable.”\n\nBea Arthur v Betty White: Golden Girls (1985-1992)\n\nOn the small screen Dorothy and Rose were the best of friends, but in real life Bea Arthur couldn’t stand Betty White.\n\n“She (Arthur) was not that fond of me,” Betty White said in 2011. “She found me a pain in the neck sometimes. It was my positive attitude — and that made Bea mad sometimes. If I was happy, she’d be furious!”\n\nAccording to Rue McClanahan (who played Blanche), the feud lasted long after the show wrapped up. Apparently in 2002, McClanahan’s husband spoke to Bea Arthur and thanked her for inviting him to her Broadway show. “I love Rue.” Arthur reportedly said, before adding, “Betty [White] is a cu**.”\n\nNick Nolte v Julia Roberts: I Love Trouble (1994)\n\nIn the film they played two competing reporters who worked together to solve a crime. But behind the scenes, Nolte and Roberts wanted nothing to do with each other.\n\nWhen the movie was done, Roberts labelled Nolte “a disgusting human being”.\n\nIn response, Nolte said, “She’s (Julia Roberts) not a nice person”.\n\n“Everyone knows that. But it’s not important to me whether I’m liked or disliked. Some people like me. Some don’t. Some people I like working with, some I don’t.”\n\nLL Cool J v Jamie Foxx: Any Given Sunday (1999)\n\nIn the football movie, Foxx and LL Cool J (real name James Todd Smith) were teammates but behind the scenes they were more like enemies. The pair came to blows onset after Cool J hit Foxx in the head during a scene, even though it wasn’t in the script. Foxx fought back and before you know it there was an all out brawl.\n\nThe police were called and Foxx filed a complaint, but no charges were laid.\n\nYou can check out the police report here.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker v Kim Cattrall: Sex and the City (1998-2004)\n\nApparently Kim Cattrall was angry that Sarah Jessica Parker got paid more than the other cast members, whereas Parker was allegedly jealous that Cattrall’s character (Samantha) was so popular with the show’s fans.\n\nThe two have always denied the feud (not surprisingly) but after the filming of Sex and the City 2, Parker did tell Marie Claire, “There are times when all of us have been sensitive and sometimes feelings get hurt.\n\n“But I don’t have any regrets about how I’ve treated people.”\n\n","byline":"ANDREW BUCKLOW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment -

This income protection should be for illnesses or injuries that are not eligible for workers compensation or other compensation schemes.”\n\nIt also argued staff should be able to be absent for 15 days’ personal leave without needing documentation. It wants it increased from eight days.\n\nSenator Bernardi labelled the document “ridiculous”.\n\n“There’s eight pages of demands but no acknowledgment of getting better value for taxpayers,” he said.\n\nCory Bernardi fires up online readers \n\nDepartment heads will sign more than 120 agreements across the public service but the new terms are subject to Government framework, which was released in March.\n\nThe Government will not agree to any pay increases unless there are clear productivity gains.\n\n","byline":"Renee Viellaris Federal Politics","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T15:01:06.000Z","description":"TAX office public servants want Australians to pay their income protection in case they get cancer – at the same time they’ve asked for more smoking breaks.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v71-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnihsrf2-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v70-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v6y-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnii5v6u-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"c55a039693dadfbe49226cb2732604bd","keywords":["income protection","personal leave","long-term illnesses","public service sweeteners","public transport timetables","enterprise agreements","Department heads","work outside","heart disease","Federal Politics","community expectations","Tax Office","Cory Bernardi","public service","public servants","minute tea breaks","clear productivity gains","workers compensation","compensation schemes","smoking breaks","Government framework"],"kicker":"Perks claim","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/australia-services-union-seeks-extra-smoking-breaks-for-tax-office-staff/story-fnihsrf2-1226975637264?sv=41bfd9fe7e79a157a0bd6e90ed6409d3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975637264","originalAssetId":"1226975637264","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"499f2248102bb8cfb3387332f5bf7de9","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"NnMnI3bjrfWw1WomqdHan3kV4NrnBNna","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f6ba2491b3d9942345ce088f27e0c123","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975639483","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THESE workers want you to pay their income protection in case they get cancer – at the same time they’ve asked for more smoking breaks.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Australia Services Union seeks extra smoking breaks for tax office staff ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["GoranMihajlovski"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"More smokos -

Probably as you smothered her. And took the life from her.’’\n\nBaden-Clay denied the accusation.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 14: Drug in Allison had ‘unusual effects’ \n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nMr Fuller told the court by April 19, 2012, the double-life Baden-Clay had been leading was about to come undone.\n\nHe said April 19 was when Baden-Clay discovered his wife and long-term lover Toni McHugh would be at the same real estate conference the following day.\n\n“If those two women came together on the 20th, there was a real risk of a catastrophe,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“Your double life would be exposed.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had promised Allison the affair was over when she had discovered his infidelity the previous September.\n\n“Your wife had forgiven you once,’’ he said.\n\n“You had no confidence she would forgive you again, did you?\n\n“And if that came about, you’d be exposed to your family, to your friends, to your profession.\n\n“The facade that was Gerard Baden-Clay will fall.’’\n\nKEEP READING TO SEE THE PROSECUTOR’S DRAMATIC INTERROGATION\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had murdered his wife at their Brookfield home, either late on the night of the 19th or during the early hours of the following morning.\n\nBut he said the former real estate agent was back home by 1.48am — when he plugged his phone back into its charger.\n\n“Perhaps she grabbed at your clothing? Is that why you had that injury under your right shoulder?’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n Baden-Clay said he could not explain how he got the red bruising near his armpit.\n\n“Perhaps her jumper came up as you tried to fight her off, up over her hands and up around her neck, or did that happen later as you moved her body and dumped her in the creek?’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“You overpowered her pretty quickly, didn’t you?\n\nBaden-Clay, often exasperated and sometimes angry during the barrage, rejected this. “I never overpowered her at all,’’ he said.\n\n“I never did anything to physically harm my wife in any way, ever. So your supposition that then takes it further to suggest I did other things as well is absurd and I object to it. I can’t answer your question.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Allison’s hair came into contact with the blanket of fallen leaves in their back garden as he took her to the Captiva car.\n\nHe told Baden-Clay she had a minor injury, something that had caused her to bleed. He said when Baden-Clay put his wife’s body in the back of her car, with the rear seats folded flat to form a boot, her blood had run down the side. “It wasn’t enough to be noticed but enough to be found,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“You transported her to Kholo Creek and then dumped her underneath the bridge unceremoniously.\n\n“Anxious to get back to your children.’’\n\nThe suggestion that Baden-Clay had abandoned his three daughters upset him.\n\n“The suggestion that I would leave my children for any time in the middle of the night is absurd, let alone to do the dastardly things that you’re suggesting,’’ Baden-Clay said. It was then, Mr Fuller said, that Baden-Clay began covering his tracks.\n\nHe loaded toys into the back of his wife’s Captiva. He took his razor and used it to cut his face at the bottom of the scratch marks to “give some legitimacy’’ to the claim he would make again and again.\n\nThe claim he had made that morning and during his trial: the marks on his face were shaving cuts, done in a hurry. “You told … anybody who asked,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n“And you kept up the facade of a concerned husband.’’ Baden-Clay denied all allegations.\n\nThe trial continues on Monday.\n\nGERARD TELLS COURT OF MANY AFFAIRS\n\nGERARD Baden-Clay has told a court he had ``many concurrent’’ affairs as he played down his long-term relationship with lover Toni McHugh.\n\nAnswering final questions in his murder trial, Baden-Clay yesterday for the first time alluded to the presence of more women in his life.\n\n``It was purely about the physical aspect of that, that I went to those other women,’’ he said, under questioning from his defence barrister.\n\n``Some of them over an extended period of time, admittedly. Many of them concurrent. But I felt like we’d put that behind us and moved on.’\n\nThe court had previously been told of Baden-Clay’s affairs with three women. One was with Ms McHugh, which lasted more than three years.\n\nAnother was with a woman at a real estate conference in Sydney, while he was with Ms McHugh.\n\nAnd the third was from earlier in his marriage, long before Ms McHugh, he has testified previously.\n\nMs McHugh was more than just a fling, prosecutor Todd Fuller QC suggested to Baden-Clay yesterday.\n\n``I suggest that you wanted to be with Toni McHugh,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\nBaden-Clay replied: That’s not correct.\n\n``She offered things that you didn’t get from the wife that you no longer loved,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\nBaden-Clay replied: ``No, that’s not true’’. He insisted he still loved his wife.\n\n``Allison and I had been through a period of about nine years where we had hardly had any physical intimacy at all,’’ he said.\n\n``Yes there were a number of women that I went to for sex. Talked about some of them during that period.\n\n``But Allison and I had recommenced our physical relationship and were rebuilding that.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay split from Ms McHugh in September 2011 after Allison discovered the affair, but went back to her three months later.\n\n``I’d suggest to you that Toni McHugh offered you a different life and that you wanted to take that opportunity,’’ Mr Fuller said.\n\n``That’s why you went back to her … because you realised you made the wrong choice in September 2011.\n\n``That’s what the start of 2012 was all about: You and Toni McHugh planning how you were going to be living together.’’\n\nGerard insisted Ms McHugh was just another of his affairs. ``I’d had a number of infidelities over the years,’’ he said.\n\n``The difference with Toni McHugh to the other women was that she worked together in the office with us.

and let commuters know where officers are on trains.\n\nThe group has amassed a following of 2,500 members since its inception.\n\nThe group has been created the same week as a grace period comes to an end on stricter rules surrounding the use of public transport for students.\n\nFull-time students who claim concession rates are now required to travel with a tertiary transport concession card (TTCC).\n\nPage creator and full-time university student PJ said the group was a necessity because there is a large amount of students who have not received their TTCC.\n\n“Students were pointing out that they still had not received their cards due to the backlog, students were in fear and at crossroads of either receiving fines or having to budget half of their finances for full fare travel,” PJ said.\n\nPJ said he was not surprised by the popularity of the page and said there was a lot of “furious” students over the implementation of the TTCC and the high fare prices of Brisbane public transport.\n\n“To protect themselves from fines they (students) are resorting to our page to keep ahead of authorities,” he said.\n\n“TransLink and the transport minister should provide an amnesty to students, who despite applying for the TTCC months ago, have yet to receive their cards.”\n\nAlthough the page may seem like it is built for fare dodgers and those looking for a free ride, PJ insists that isn’t quite right.\n\n“Fare dodging isn’t quite the term; it’s simply there to protect the students who have been caught up in a bureaucratic bungle with the botched implementation of the TTCC.”\n\nTransLink said anyone caught rorting public transport can expect to receive a $227 fine.\n\n“Safety is our top priority and our officers are intentionally highly visible on the TransLink network to act as a deterrent to anti-social or other illegal behaviour and so protect the public, TransLink said.\n\n“They are constantly moving across all of our bus and train routes to ensure customer safety and to target fare evasion across the entire network.”\n\nTransLink said most offences on the network occur in the busiest stations, such as Roma St, Beenleigh and South Bank train stations and Cultural Centre, Brisbane CBD and Southport for buses.\n\n","byline":"Chris McMahon ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD

the Supreme Court in Brisbane.\n\nTweets by @KateKyriacou \n\n1.15pm: The 75th witness in the trial is psychiatrist Dr Mark Schramm.\n\nHe said he worked chiefly in forensic psychiatry, including in the prison mental health service, but also worked privately.\n\nDr Schramm said he looked at Allison Baden-Clay’s autopsy report, doctor records, as well as psychology consultation notes and records.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay was first diagnosed with relapsing major depression disorder, with features of anxiety, by Dr Tom George in 2003.\n\nDr Schramm said that meant it had a longitudinal course that waxed, waned and recurred upon one of her pregnancies.\n\n“It wasn’t just a single episode it was more than one episode,” he said.\n\nHe said the symptoms of the disorder included a depressed mood, self-doubt, anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nDr Schramm said there was a link between major depression and suicide.\n\n“Studies for the rate of suicide vary … but probably one of the most well-respected studies performed by people who work in Australia or even Brisbane suggests that 3.4 per cent of people who experience depression will take their lives,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not universal for people who took their own lives to leave a note.\n\n“More than half do not,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for suicide to be a surprise to loved ones, friends and relatives.\n\n“It is also the case that very often, and unfortunately suicide is a surprise, and even in retrospect it has been impossible to predict,” he said.\n\nKEEP READING BELOW FOR FULL COVERAGE FROM DAY 14 OF THE BADEN-CLAY TRIAL\n\nDr Schramm said around half of those who ended their lives had seen a medical professional in the two weeks prior.\n\n“I think it’s folly to assume that simply because you have a medical degree or you are a psychologist or a psychiatrist that you can confidently predict or rule out when someone might kill themselves,” he said.\n\n“It’s human nature to assume that experts have the answers.”\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for experts to “miss” someone who was at risk.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Danny Boyle, Dr Schramm agreed he had not interviewed anyone in relation to his assessment.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found

heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nHe agreed his opinions were based on medical notes and records.\n\nDr Schramm agreed his remarks were general and related to people who suffered depression.\n\nHe asked the psychiatrist about maternal attachment.\n\n“If someone has a strong attachment to her children and she has a concern as to their wellbeing, an ongoing concern, that would indicate a high level of attachment which would be a protective factor against suicide?” Mr Boyle said.\n\nDr Schramm said it would reduce the risk Ms Baden-Clay would harm herself.\n\n“I accept that is something that goes against the argument that she was suicidal,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked if suicide was likely if there had been no triggering event.\n\n“I’d suggest there could be some triggering events that we don’t know about, some triggering events that are internal, but I accept that knowing there is no triggering event … it is less likely,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed a person making short and long-term plans would make one “less concerned” they would harm themselves.\n\n“A decision may have occurred after such plans, long term or medium term, were made,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked about the likely suicide risk of a person who had been proactive in the past about seeking assistance from counsellors and doctors.\n\n“In general I would accept Allison seemed to be someone who put her hand up when she wasn’t coping and sought help,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed symptoms of depression could become worse during pregnancy.\n\nHe agreed doctors could increase an anti-depressant dose in order to control mood swings around menstruation.\n\nDr Schramm said he did not know when Ms Baden-Clay was last actively depressed.\n\n“The records show one of her most recent attendances on her GP at the Kenmore clinic, which was sometime in March, indicated she was complaining of mood swings,” he said.\n\nHe said he noticed a note in Ms Baden-Clay’s session with Carmel Ritchie in which she spoke of feeling “not good enough”.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne, Dr Schramm said it was not his belief the increase of sertraline dosage would be likely to have caused suicidal ideation.\n\n“You would normally expect that increased risk when someone first starts on that medication,” he said.\n\nHe added that depression was a factor for suicide.\n\nDr Schramm agreed he noted Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing possibly depressive cognitions at an appointment with counsellor Carmel Ritchie.\n\n“When people are depressed they look at life through grey-coloured glasses … they evaluate situations themselves in a more negative light through grey glasses. That often is associated with feelings of guilt and inadequacy and I appreciate it is simply cherry-picking one statement, but that struck me as something that may well have been said by someone who is depressed,” he said.\n\n“It may also represent the words of someone who may have as part of their personality, had some self-doubt.\n\n“I don’t think we should draw great certainty from one statement like that but that is certainly not inconsistent with someone who is depressed.”\n\nDr Schramm said Ms Baden-Clay’s visit to a doctor to treat mood swings around menstruation on March 19, 2012 were not “inconsistent” with depression.\n\n“It’s not inconsistent with it, that’s all I can say. It’s consistent with the GP assessing that she was depressed,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed the notes of Ms Baden-Clay’s doctor in 2011, which revealed Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing guilt, low mood and tears.\n\n“They all signify a high chance that she was relapsing in her depressive illness,” he said.\n\nThe defence closed its case.\n\nJustice John Byrne told the jury all the evidence to be put before them in the trial had been presented.\n\nHe said lawyers’ addresses to the jury would begin on Monday, first with defence counsel Mr Byrne and followed by an address from prosecutor Mr Fuller.\n\nJustice Byrne said he would then sum up the case to the jury and they would retire to consider a verdict.\n\nThe trial was adjourned until 10am Monday.\n\n12.45pm: The 74th witness in the trial is forensic toxicologist Dr Michael Robertson.\n\nHe said he had been a forensic toxicologist for 20 years and had studied widely in his field.\n\nDr Robertson said he did a toxicological examination of the results obtained from Allison Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said the review was of Ms Baden-Clay’s post mortem results and the levels of a particular drug, called sertraline.\n\n“Sertaline is the active drug within the commercial or trade name medication Zoloft,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said it was an anti-depressant and elevated levels of serotonin in the brain, or mood-elevating chemicals, to reduce depression\n\nHe said sertraline was a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI), which increased levels of serotonin in the brain.\n\nHe said the drug would be broken down and metabolised into desmethyl sertraline.\n\nDr Robertson said the levels of sertraline in the blood of Ms Baden-CLay was .59mg/kg and levels of desmethyl sertraline were at 3.3mg/kg.\n\nHe said there was also some detected in the stomach and liver, at 5mg/kg and desmethly sertraline of 31mg/kg.\n\nDr Robertson said it was unusual for levels to be above 0.05mg/kg in a person.\n\nHe said average numbers he expected in a living person taking sertraline was 0.03mg/kg.\n\nHe said Ms Baden-Clay’s levels were elevated.\n\nDr Robertson said drug concentrations in the body usually altered after death, a phenomenon known as “post-mortem redistribution”.\n\nHe said studies showed sertraline redistribution usually did not change too much after death but tended towards being slightly higher.\n\nHe said elevated levels could be caused by the ingestion of a different amount of drug to the recommended therapeutic amount.\n\n“It might be there is an unusual amount of redistribution in this case, some level of contamination may have occurred during the post-mortem,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said there were a number of side-effects for sertraline, including common adverse effects such as anxiety, agitation, confusion, thermo-regulation or an elevation of temperature, and even serotonin syndrome or toxicity.\n\n“This is a well described adverse event that involves unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said serotonin effects varied from individual to individual.\n\nDr Robertson said serotonin syndrome occurred when levels were too high and started to affect other areas of the brain.\n\n“When you get too much of this drug you can get situations again where more profound confusion might exist in a general way, increased agitation, unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said studies showed individuals who were taking “SSRIs” were more likely to experience suicidal ideation.\n\n“The mechanism behind that is simply unclear … it usually happens when someone first starts to take medication or alters medication, those sort of things,” he said.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Dr Robertson agreed trace levels of serotonin in the stomach may have been transferred there after death.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay would not be described as a “naïve” patient as she had been on Zoloft since 2003.\n\nDr Robertson agreed she would have likely developed a tolerance to the drug.\n\nHe agreed redistribution of drugs in the body meant levels in the extremities, such as a leg, would not increase as much as drug concentrations in the centre of the body.\n\n“The theory being if significant post-mortem redistribution takes place, the concentration in the central blood should have increased … more than it would in the peripheral blood,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson agreed drug concentration levels depended on time, the position of the body and leeching of fat from the body.\n\nHe said the liver would break down sertraline.\n\nHe agreed the fact the blood sample was from the liver was a factor in interpreting the concentration levels.\n\nDr Robertson agreed sertraline was usually reported as a multi-drug cause of death, rather than a drug alone.\n\nHe agreed the levels of serotonin in the blood were not consistent with an overdose causing death.\n\n“I would agree they are not necessarily consistent with those numbers,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said he could not say the serotonin levels were inconsistent with causing death.\n\n“I can’t necessarily agree with that completely as I can’t explain the elevated drug concentrations completely, they might have been elevated for some reason … whether they indirectly had some involvement, I don’t know,” he said.\n\nIn re-examination by Mr Byrne, Dr Robertson said serotonin syndrome could occur in a regular user when the dose was increased.\n\n12.05pm: The 73rd witness in the trial is Ashton Ward who is the manager of a company called “Khemistry”.\n\nHe was called to give evidence by barrister Michael Byrne QC, for Gerard Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said he did time-lapse recordings of the tidal movements at the Kholo Creek Bridge between June 12, 2014 and June 22, 2014.\n\nMr Ward said the film was still images that were converted into a time-lapse video.\n\nHe said the camera was set to take a photo image every 2 minutes during daylight hours.\n\nHe said that was switched to once every three minutes on June 18, 2014.\n\nThe time-lapse videos were played to the jury, one a closer view than the other.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Mr Ward agreed the photos were initially taken every two minutes, so that one second equalled 50 minutes.\n\nHe said when it was changed to take one photo every three minutes, it became one second to every 75 minutes.\n\nMr Ward agreed he did not know what the area looked like in 2012.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay

Fuller QC he went to see doctors on the advice of his lawyers.\n\nHe agreed police took photos of him on April 21, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could not remember telling police about the injuries on his torso.\n\nHe agreed people were concerned about the marks on his cheek.\n\n“When you say concerned, yeah, they kept saying that they had a concern so that concerned me so I told them what it was,” he said.\n\nHe said the injuries on his torso were “self-inflicted” and “just didn’t seem relevant”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he went to another doctor on the afternoon of April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he gave one of the doctors his business card and offered to give her assistance moving to the area.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused about the deed of variation he signed in order to obtain the rent roll in late 2011.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he would suffer a significant financial loss and return to owning just a quarter share in the rent roll business, if he defaulted on the variation.\n\nMr Fuller suggested the loss the accused would incur for defaulting on the rent roll variation was $46,800.\n\nHe asked Baden-Clay what loss he would incur if his wife left him.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife was not paid a salary.\n\nHe agreed they had an investment property together, shares and an investment property.\n\nMr Fuller said couple had a net assets worth of $74,663.\n\n“You are asking an awful lot of hypothetical questions that I … I honestly can’t answer that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed there would have been financial consequences for him if he separated from his wife.\n\n“If Allison and I had determined we were doing to separate, divorce or something like that, how that played out, I honestly don’t know,” he said.\n\n“I can’t now remember exactly why I told her that but it seemed to placate her at that time.”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he faced pressures on April 19, 2012 but they were “not significant”.\n\n“You put to me yesterday that Allison required certain things of me, including that I not go out at night, that I hand my phone to her, that I put that find friends application on my phone and I should clarify … I felt satisfied I had answered truthfully and factually answered all the questions you asked … it was actually my suggestion to load that application on our phones,” he said.\n\nThe accused said both he and his wife knew how to turn it off.\n\n“And on the one day I needed it, it failed me, that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller said the app didn’t stop the accused from meeting Toni McHugh or contacting her regularly.\n\n“That is correct. Predominantly instigated by Toni, but yes that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller suggested Baden-Clay wanted to be with Ms McHugh.\n\n“Allison and I had recommenced our physical relationship that year and as I mentioned yesterday Allison and I had gone for around 9 years … yes, there were a number of women I went to for sex around that period … but Allison and I were rebuilding,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he was betraying his wife’s trust and continuing to do so on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I suggest to you Toni McHugh offered you a different life and you wanted to take that opportunity?,” Mr Fuller asked.\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, that’s not correct.”\n\nThe accused said he was “very ashamed” by his infidelity and wanted to put it behind him to move forward with his wife.\n\n“I did not feel that,” he said, of Ms McHugh and his wife meeting at the real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was “placating” Ms McHugh when he told her he loved her.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused if he would be exposed if his wife met Ms McHugh at the conference.\n\nHe argued she would find out about his affairs, the emails and the fact they had met for sex again since her discovery of the affair in September, 2011.\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed your wife, Mr Baden-Clay?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed her either in or at your house at Brookfield that night or in the early hours of the morning?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You attacked her and the only way she could respond was to lash out and claw at your face and leave marks upon it?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller: “Probably as you smothered her and took her life from her?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller suggested his wife grabbed at his clothing, causing marks under his arm.\n\nMr Fuller: “You overpowered her pretty quickly, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “I never overpowered her at all … I never did anything to physically harm my wife in any way, ever, so your supposition and to take it further to suggest I did other things is absurd and I object to it. So I can’t answer your question.”\n\nHe said he did not know if his wife’s head came into contact with leaves in their backyard.\n\n“I did not have anything to do with anything that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked if he put his wife into the back of their Holden Captiva.\n\n“I had nothing to do with anything that you are asking me,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not dump his wife’s body off Kholo Creek Bridge.\n\n“The suggestion that I would leave my children for any time in the middle of the night is absurd, let alone to do the dastardly things that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nHe said he did not put his phone on charge at 1.48am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not shave over the scratch marks on his face.\n\n“I did not,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he let police to search his home.\n\n“I had nothing to hide,” he said.\n\n“I was a concerned husband and I’m a very concerned father, I remain so. It is not a facade.”\n\nThe accused agreed he took legal advice and did not give a formal statement to police.\n\n“My lawyer insisted upon it and so I followed that advice,” he said.\n\nHe said he never told his wife on the night she disappeared that she would run into Ms McHugh the next day.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne QC, Baden-Clay reiterated he was never violent towards his wife on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I’ve never thrown a punch in my life in anger,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he and his wife had disagreed during their marriage but never by being disrespectful to one another.\n\nHe said he did not hear any noises that night.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not deceive his wife about anything other than his infidelity over the four years before her death.\n\nHe said he did not deceive his family and friends about anything else apart from his infidelity.\n\n“Deceive is a strong word but I protected Allison in relation to the extent of her depression, which we didn’t really know much about in the early years and Allison was very, very conscious that she really didn’t want anybody to know that she suffered from any mental illness so, certainly I protected Allison and didn’t tell any friends and family about her mental illness,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he deceived Ms McHugh by telling her there was a possibility they had a future together.\n\nHe said he was relieved when his wife discovered his affair with Ms McHugh but he did not tell her about other women he met for sex.\n\n“I had no intention of telling Allison about the other women.\n\n“I didn’t want to jeopardise any chance we had of making a future together, further, it was purely about the physical aspect that I went to those other women … over an extended period of time, admittedly,” he said.\n\nThe accused said there were occasions when he questioned whether it was beneficial for his wife to know intimate details of his affair with Ms McHugh.\n\nHe said counsellors told them it would be helpful for his wife to have her questions answered, but in his experience, it did not seem to be helpful to her.\n\nBaden-Clay said counsellor Carmel Ritchie put structure into those conversations and he felt more confident about having those discussions with his wife.\n\nHe said Ms McHugh did not stay at his house, but rather visited.\n\n“We’d had some physical intimacy at the house, I had told Allison about that, on one occasion she had a spare room at that point and there was a spare bed and we no longer had that … and a spare mattress,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he was concerned Ms McHugh was not coping very well and he wanted her to have the strength to get on with her life and find someone else.\n\n“In retrospect, looking at some of the things I said and did, it was pretty naïve and pretty stupid, but that was my intention,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told Ms McHugh he did not want to be intimate with her until he was out of the marriage with his wife.\n\n“I felt stronger and more confident I would be able to maintain the distance if we weren’t seeing each other,” he said.\n\nHe said he hoped they would one day be friends.\n\n“I wanted to make sure we just had no physical relationship with each other at all,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed it was not a concern for him the two women in his life – mistress and wife - would meet at a real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said it was not in his wife’s nature to be confrontational or to “cause a scene”.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought his wife would have anticipated Ms McHugh would have been there, anyway, adding that she had colleague Kate Rankin with her.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh had a volatile personality but in a public environment, was “always able to control herself”.\n\n“I really had no concern at all,” he said.\n\nThe jury was shown a page from his wife’s journal.\n\nIn it was written: “I don’t want to be alone. I am afraid of being alone and lonely maybe because I think I can’t handle it. I am afraid of failing – failing in my marriage and what people would think.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why his wife had written such a thing but believed it to be her handwriting.\n\nThe trial will resume at 11.50am.\n\n10.45am: The jury will today hear continued cross-examination of the accused by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC.\n\nIt will be Gerard Baden-Clay’s fourth day in the witness box.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused whether he thought his wife may have had contact with his mistress Toni McHugh on April 19, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not think so.\n\nHe agreed his wife had his phone that night and Ms McHugh could have contacted him.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed his mistress knew where he lived.\n\nHe said he did not remember Ms McHugh telling him that not going to the conference on April 20, 2012 was not an option.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought it was “probable” Ms McHugh would not call him after hours.\n\n“By the end of the conversation she had calmed down a fair bit,” he said of a heated discussion with Ms McHugh in the late afternoon of April 19, 2012.\n\nHe said he did not tell police about his dealings with Ms McHugh on that day.\n\nThe accused said he did not tell his family about the affair until he was told by a journalist it would be disclosed in a story.\n\nBaden-Clay said he told the police.\n\n“I didn’t anticipate the police were going to inform the media, but they did,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he spoke to police at the Brookfield Showgrounds on April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he spoke to police on numerous occasions over those days and “answered every and any question they asked me”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he did not make a formal statement.\n\n“That was the only thing that they asked me and I told them and had a lengthy conversation with (Sgt) Chris Canniffe … I pleaded with him and said I’ve been given legal advice and said what would you do in my position and it was Mr Canniffe who calmed the situation,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he wasn’t sure what CIB stood for or what a crime scene was.\n\n“I believe there were a couple of police I spoke to who were from the homicide,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he first met Sen-Sgt Narelle Curtis during a siege situation involving a cult at a property at Anstead.\n\n“I think Narelle may have been the officer in charge when that all occurred,” he said.\n\nHe agreed that was a positive dealing.\n\nBaden-Clay said he occasionally attended meetings with a Kenmore Police consulting committee.\n\nHe said police were “probably” in contact with him every day following his wife’s disappearance.\n\nThe accused said Sgt Canniffe was at first, very responsive, but as the days passed took longer to reply to phone calls.\n\n“I was very concerned about the whereabouts of my wife and often one communication and one text message a day was not enough for me, I desperately wanted to know what was going on,” he said.\n\nHe said he first spoke to his lawyer around midday on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said he met his lawyer at a Yatala service station complex midway between his office on the Gold Coast and Brookfield that night.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed the first call he made to his wife was at 6.32am.\n\nHe said he thought he sent her a text message before that but it was not recorded on the summary provided to the court.\n\n“I don’t know why,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he phoned his family at 6.44am.\n\n“My initial call was just to say have you heard from her or anything and in that conversation … they came over and helped,” he said.\n\nThe accused agreed he did not call his wife’s friends Kerry-Anne Walker or Wendy Mollah, in part because they lived too far away and he did not have Ms Mollah’s number at that time.\n\nHe said he did not get through to his parent’s house at Kenmore until 6.46am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he took the Holden Captiva to look for his wife because his Prado had been in a car crash on Monday April 16, 2012.\n\nHe agreed his car, the Prado, was parked closer to the driveway.\n\nHe further agreed the Captiva had been parked nose-in to the car port.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he had driven the Prado all week despite the accidents, just not on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said the car was not reversed into the car port when he got up that day.\n\nThe jury was shown a photo of Baden-Clay’s damaged Prado, which was side-swiped on the Monday before his wife went missing, parked in front of his wife’s car parked behind it in the car port.\n\n“There was nothing to stop me taking the Prado,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he first noticed the toys in the back of the Holden Captiva the morning his wife went missing.\n\nHe said it was not a “total surprise” to him they were in the car.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not put the toys in the back of the car.\n\nMr Fuller: “You didn’t move them there to make it look … normal, or a semblance of normal?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not put them there.”\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents at 9.30am.\n\n“I thought that she’d gone for a walk I called them later on when the police were there,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he called them after he was “interrogated” by police for a couple of hours.\n\nMr Fuller: “But you called your friends first, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he called his closest friends before he called his wife’s closest friends, Ms Walker and Ms Mollah.\n\nHe said police did not prevent him from making calls on April 20, 2012.\n\nThe accused agreed police let him call his children’s school and take a call from the president of the P&C.\n\nHe agreed police were supportive of him with respect to his children and his dealings with the school.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was not concerned by the line of questioning from police, not like his father or his sister.\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents as soon as he could.\n\n“I couldn’t see, my informing them was not necessarily for them to drop everything and come up, obviously that’s a natural reaction and that’s what they did,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not call Ms McHugh, either.\n\nHe agreed his wife was at least an hour overdue by 8am.\n\nThe accused agreed it was “completely out of character” for his wife to be late to meet a colleague, such as Kate Rankin, or an appointment.\n\n“I didn’t ring her parents until there was an opportunity to do so,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused again why he rang his friends before he phoned his wife’s friends.\n\n“I called the Christs because we had plans for a sleepover that evening … I wanted them to be aware that Allison was missing and I wanted to ask if they had seen anything, I didn’t think that she would have walked to their house … we didn’t have any close friends … but I just didn’t think it was likely,” he said.\n\n“I anticipated she was coming home any minute but I was concerned about what was going to happen in the afternoon.\n\n“If Allison was in hospital and we found her, that would obviously throw all the plans…”\n\nHe said he called the Cheesmans because their home was going on sale that day and he was going to put some finishing touches on the property that day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he asked his father to go in his stead, but he was prevented from doing so by the police.\n\n“I was concerned about my wife but I obviously had my family and my business that was operating as well,” he said.\n\nHe agreed an employee took over the Cheesmans open house the next day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why he called his friend Peter Cranna that day, then added it was because he lived close by.\n\nHe agreed he and his wife had significant insurance policies.\n\nBaden-Clay said they had discussed reducing them because the premiums were high.\n\nHe agreed he contacted an insurance agency on May 1, 2012 about making a claim, at his father’s behest.\n\nThe accused said he was at his office when a media report came through on April 30, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he went to Brisbane city and met his lawyer and barrister Peter Davis in his chambers.\n\nHe agreed police told him a body had been found.\n\n“They confirmed it was Allison,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller: “Are you confident of that?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Yes, because we knew a body had been found and it was at that meeting they told us they were sure it was Allison. I remember being physically shocked by that.”\n\n10am: Gerard Baden-Clay will face more cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller today.\n\nThere is a short delay for legal discussion, the trial will begin when the jury enters the court.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nYesterday, the court heard that for four years Gerard Baden-Clay deceived everyone – his wife, his lover, his friends and family.\n\nHe lied to his wife when he told her his affair was over. He lied to his lover when he told her he would walk out on his marriage.\n\nHe deceived his friends and family when he told them he was happily married, that all was well in his relationship with his wife.\n\nUnder a fast-paced cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller, Gerard Baden-Clay admitted that for years he lived a double life, lying constantly to those closest to him.\n\nBaden-Clay told a Supreme Court jury he deceived his wife Allison about his affairs with three different women and continued to see his mistress Toni McHugh even after she found out about his infidelity.\n\nHe said he repeatedly told Ms McHugh he loved her to “placate her’’ and her volatile personality but didn’t tell Allison she and his mistress would be attending the same conference because there was “no risk’’ Ms McHugh would do anything rash.\n\n“There were a number of occasions when you had to say things to avoid the consequences of your actions during these couple of years, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller asked Baden-Clay during the accused murderer’s third day on the stand.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct.\n\nTweets by @TheMurrayD \n\n“You deceived your family and friends for that four year period as well, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller pressed.\n\n“Led them to believe you were happily married … that everything was good within your relationship with your wife.’’\n\nBaden-Clay agreed.\n\n“That you were a success, that your business was going well – and that was what was most important to you, wasn’t it? What people saw of you.’’\n\n“I wouldn’t say that,’’ Baden-Clay replied.\n\nBaden-Clay also told the court it meant nothing that he chose his wife’s birthday as the date he would walk out of his marriage in an email to his lover.\n\n“You went on to give her a date when you would be together, the 1st of July … which just happened to be your wife’s birthday,’’ Mr Fuller asked, referring to the email Baden-Clay sent Ms McHugh on April 3, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct, adding “which also happens to be today’’.\n\n“But you didn’t think about that when you sent that email, that was just coincidence, was it?’’ Mr Fuller said. Baden-Clay replied: “It was.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had sent that email as his wife worked to rebuild their damaged relationship, including finding them a marriage counsellor. “And behind her back, this is the message you are sending to Toni McHugh,’’ he said.\n\nBaden-Clay faltered when Mr Fuller asked him the first time he’d told his wife he didn’t love her.\n\n“The conversations that we had were, please forgive me, I’m just trying to recollect for you … I’m trying to see if I can think if I can give a reference in time,’’ Baden-Clay said.\n\n“I think it must have been in 2009, perhaps when we first went to see (psychologist Dr Tom George) and we had a few conversations around then.\n\n“We agreed to go together and it was after conversations with Dr George that we had further discussions with Allison that I (said I) still loved her but I didn’t feel ‘in love’ with her.’’\n\nHe was also pressed on a list of questions Allison had written in her journal to ask Gerard during one of their 15 minute “talks’’ recommended by marriage counsellor Carmel Ritchie in the days before she disappeared.\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay lied when he claimed their talk had been on April 18, instead of April 19 as he’d initially indicated to police.\n\nBaden-Clay insisted Allison had asked him the questions from her journal on April 18. He said he didn’t know why she’d written “why so mean’’. “I don’t know and if she had been able to ask me that question she would have been able to expand upon that,” he said.\n\nThe trial continues today.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Baskin, Kate Kyriacou ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T04:32:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:33:24.000Z","description":"IT is day 14 of the trial of former Brookfield real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, who stands accused of murdering his wife Allison Baden-Clay, 43, on April 19, 2012.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v71-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v70-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6y-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6u-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"71b9788dda62a499b3666ccde095a5e8","keywords":["accused murderer","marriage counsellor","double life","fast-paced cross examination","Murder accused","damaged relationship","Allison Baden-Clay","volatile personality","life insurance","Digital manipulation","multiple affairs","four-year period","fast-paced prosecution cross-examination","Brisbane","Queensland","Australia","Supreme Court","Todd Fuller","Toni McHugh","Carmel Ritchie","Kate Kyriacou"],"kicker":"’Elevated levels’","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226974352079?sv=ee4facf17670540a5cb2150f3d3d9308","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974352079","originalAssetId":"1226974352079","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"f5320252a2bbe17c3551c675e6a182cd","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"9jZDdrbjpJnFSrI0N-jePXucmY0Jn06x","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"2c3ec8e8443e2498892462cc80bbbe15","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"0wM2Zrbjr_2IG7bczHuuhP2XJ18zd2LR","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f174c0b74973890268cb07f312992d3d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974349919","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58d6ea842e84273d6251a12f62cf214a","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"BteG9qbjpjXJKSWDj3BAbjoY_c0foFfK","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58c6342cb22789a6a4985b76c372a53e","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"F0aDBrbjpB3aP0WhQmgL_FovtRXrMFzB","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"ee6d7eaad7142f94c449f56eac2d8e61","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"ZmcmlrbjoAkw1AYzzBjIIkHPLI0SMD4g","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A FORENSIC toxicologist says he found “elevated levels” of a drug in Allison Baden-Clay’s system - a drug with side effects that involve “unusual behaviours”.

decision on Wednesday.\n\nIt will mean the loss of 27 operational and office-based jobs as well as 25 casual and labouring staff.\n\nForgacs CEO Lindsay Stratton attributed the closure to the high Australian dollar and low costs of competing Asian shipyards.\n\n“We have tried hard to avoid this outcome but cannot ignore the fact that our ­financial forecast and trading experience both confirm the closure of the site is the only option,” Mr Stratton said.\n\nBut for employees such as third-generation mechanical fitter Robert Proctor (pictured), this has done little to ease the pain of losing a job.\n\n“I’ll try to find some work as soon as possible because I have a wife and a 20-month-old little girl,” Mr Proctor said. “We are a fairly young workforce so there are a lot of wives and kids and mortgages that need to be looked after.”\n\nMr Proctor worked at Forgacs for more than eight years and said the mood at yesterday’s meeting was sombre.\n\n“We were also a bit relieved because it has been hanging over our heads for a while,” he said.\n\n“It’s sad to see 70 years of ship repair at this site finished.”\n\nJust five years ago Forgacs, Australia’s largest privately owned shipbuilding and repair company, employed more than 200 permanent staff at the 15ha shipyard site, working to restore large cruise liners such as the P & O cruise ship ­Pacific Dawn.\n\nWhile the closure of the shipyard won’t impact Forgacs engineering operations in Gladstone, Garden Island in Sydney and Newcastle, the ship has sailed on the Brisbane site for good.\n\nAs the city’s second dock, the Cairncross site was constructed in 1942 and officially opened two years later.\n\nThe site was taken over by Keppel in 1994 and then purchased by Forgacs in 1999.\n\nA spokesperson for Forgacs told The Courier-Mail operations had been slow for the past five years.\n\nFederal MP for Griffith, Terri Butler, whose electorate covers the dockyard, tweeted that it was a “sad end for a significant site”.\n\nIf you know more contact: rhian.deutrom@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"Rhian Deutrom ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM

ingredients for a cold night — clear skies, light winds and very cold air mass lingering,” he said.\n\n“This will last for another couple of nights until we have another front pushing through on Friday and Saturday which will strengthen the northern winds and warm those temperatures over the weekend … not too much though, it’s still winter.”\n\nHe said fog and frost would be seen over the next couple of days.\n\nApplethorpe local Ronda Speranza said her family’s property was covered in frost this morning.\n\n“Already I can see the pipes are about to freeze,” she said.\n\nBut she said the morning frost was often welcomed by locals.\n\n“It’s absolutely beautiful in the day time because there’s no wind … the frost is an advantage because it means we are going to have a lovely

Before Origin I, Maroons coach Mal Meninga spoke of the perils of any player in Origin contention jeopardising their selection for the sake of a “big night out”.\n\nIn a radio interview, he added he would drop Queensland half Cooper Cronk if he committed the same indiscretion as Pearce, who was duly axed by NSW coach Laurie Daley.\n\nMeninga is famed for his loyalty, but has previously warned Queensland stars he will not tolerate any erosion of the cultural standards he has set since 2006.\n\nIt is the second consecutive campaign the Maroons have been caught in a police probe, with forward Ben Te’o last year quizzed over the alleged assault of a Brisbane woman.\n\nTe’o was cleared of any wrongdoing and the Chambers saga is a ruction the Maroons can do without as they fight to avert a 3-0 series rout this Wednesday night.\n\nMeninga declined to comment last night but said on May 20 he was proud of the culture Queensland had cultivated during their eight-year reign.\n\n“I’m very thankful that the quality of player in the Queensland side puts the game first,” Meninga said.\n\n“They understand their responsibilities and don’t jeopardise their positions or opportunity to be selected in the Queensland side and that makes me very happy.\n\n“Part of that responsibility is setting the right examples.\n\n“This group of young men want to play for Queensland.\n\n“I’m extremely proud of who we have in our team and that’s why they get picked all the time.”\n\nBrisbane duo Dale Copley and Daniel Vidot are possible wing options if Chambers is stood down.\n\nChambers declined to comment upon arriving in camp on Wednesday.\n\nThe NRL released a statement on Wednesday night, saying: “The NRL’s Integrity Unit has been advised of an incident involving a Queensland State of Origin player.\n\n“It will liaise with the Queensland Rugby League and relevant authorities on the matter.\n\n“The Integrity Unit will advise the outcome of its inquiries when the matter is finalised.”\n\n","byline":"Peter Badel ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/State of Origin - Maroons news and

to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\n4.35pm: Gerard Baden-Clay said he did not remember telling a police officer he and his wife were “on the bones of their ass” on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe added they were not “flush with cash” at the time.\n\nCrown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC honed in on Baden-Clay’s business dealings.\n\nThe accused said he had shifted from a desire to open several smaller offices to building one large, centralised office.\n\nBaden-Clay said salaries paid to individual partners of roughly $5500 per week was not a sustainable model because money was not being reinvested back into the business.\n\nHe said the Lexus he bought was a poor financial decision, adding that his children had named it “Midi”, short for “Midnight”, or as he liked to refer to it, “a midlife crisis”.\n\nBaden-Clay said he had a contract to purchase the rent roll of his real estate business.\n\nHe said he and his wife had some investments but by April, 2011 had not liquidated them to help the business, instead accepting $270,000 from a trio of friends.\n\nKEEP READING BELOW FOR FULL COVERAGE FROM DAY 13 OF THE BADEN-CLAY TRIAL\n\nHe said his business partners wanted to close the doors in 2011 but he did not.\n\nHe agreed the business incurred significant expenses and that was compounded by the floods.\n\n“I think without the floods we would have been able to trade out of that situation but the floods really knocked us around,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he bought out his partners’ share of the sales business for $1 each.\n\nHe agreed he wrote partner Jocelyn Frost a cheque for $10,000 as part of an incentive plan paid in advance but she left the business, while still owning a 50 per cent share of his rent roll.\n\nBaden-Clay said loans from his friends were unsecured.\n\nHe agreed he was risking some of their capital.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was still to determine how the money would be repaid as well as the terms of the agreement in April, 2012.\n\nHe said some of their discussion centred on whether his three friends and investors would take an equity share of the business down the track or a share in the rent roll.\n\nThe accused said Phil Broom and Jocelyn Frost each paid $25,000 to buy into Baden-Clay’s real estate business.\n\nMr Fuller asked Baden-Clay whether borrowing from his long-standing friends had put pressure on him.\n\nThe accused agreed.\n\nBaden-Clay said he had conversations with Century 21 chairman Charles Tarbey, as well as other financial institutions, to secure finances to buy out the rent roll by a contract dated on November 23, 2011.\n\nHe agreed the rent roll would cost him $300,003.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was not able to secure the money at that point.\n\nHe said he did not remember discussing borrowing more money from his friends in order to purchase the rent roll.\n\nThe accused agreed he asked Moggill MP Dr Bruce Flegg, instead.\n\nHe said the variation of the contract was finalised on December 20, 2011, reducing the sum payable from $300,003 to just $30,000.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed the remaining $270,000 was due on June 30, 2012 with a 90-day extension option.\n\nThe accused agreed the variation of the contract required him to pay $1200 to one partner, and $600 to the other, in the meantime.\n\n“That was an agreed interest payment ... on the amount of moneys that was still outstanding to settle the contract,” he said.\n\nHe said if he missed a payment the whole business would revert back to its original shareholding.\n\n“If I were indeed in such dire financial circumstances, I could roll up and depart the business relatively unscathed,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said his friends went into the financial arrangement with him “with their eyes wide open” and understanding there was a risk they would lose everything.\n\nThe accused agreed Ms Susanne Heath phoned him in Dr Flegg’s stead in March, 2012.\n\nHe said Dr Flegg told him he wasn’t able to assist at that time but to contact him again.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he pulled Dr Flegg aside at a chamber of commerce meeting and questioned whether he had told others his business was in trouble.\n\nHe agreed he told Dr Flegg he did not want another equity partner in the business.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not believe he told Ms Heath he was facing bankruptcy if he could not secure a loan of $300,000 from Dr Flegg.\n\nHe said he did not cry out of a concern for his business facing bankruptcy, but because Ms Heath asked him how he was.\n\n“She said: ‘How are you?’ and I remember I actually broke into tears at that moment because nobody ever asked me how I was,” he said.\n\n“I certainly may have indicated to her that I was keen to get the funding from somewhere but I wouldn’t have indicated to her that I was going to go bankrupt,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he remembered telling his mistress Toni McHugh he would sell the business on one occasion.\n\n“But I wasn’t going to sell the business. I was yet again saying something to her to placate her and calm her down. I mean we’ve already been through this across two phone calls, 30 minute phone calls that we had that afternoon … and by the end of the conversation it was my recollection she had calmed down a little bit,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told Ms McHugh a lie that day, on April 19, 2012.\n\nThe accused agreed he had properties at Anstead and had driven over the bridge at Kholo Creek.\n\n“That road, if you drive along it, at Mt Crosby Rd, becomes a roller coaster, I would have been aware it crossed a creek, maybe two, I wasn’t familiar with it,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused about the police investigation into his wife’s disappearance on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed both he and his sister had driven some of his wife’s walking routes, he had called his wife, her car and keys were at the house and the prospect was something serious had happened.\n\n“My mind was in a spin, in a world of wondering what might have happened to her, obviously if she had slipped and fallen over and been knocked unconscious … really that was foremost in my mind as to what might have happened,” he said.\n\nHe agreed he was asked about the nature of his relationship with his wife.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused whether there were two possibilities of what had happened to his wife: that she was taken from the house or abducted while on her walk.\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is a possibility and there are innumerable other possibilities, too.”\n\nHe agreed police searched his backyard and told him her phone had been triangulated to an area near their home, extending out 4km.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told police he had an affair, he and his wife had been to see a counsellor, they had spoken about it the night before but did not fight or argue.\n\nHe agreed police asked him about his wife’s mental health, medication she was taking and the state of their relationship.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed the police asked questions about the scratches on their face.\n\nHe agreed the police were doing all they could do to progress their investigation into where his wife was.\n\n“There was one point when I had been sitting at the table … when I said ‘what are we doing sitting around here, why aren’t we out looking for Allison, that’s what I want to be doing now… how are we going to find Allison if we are all standing around here?’,” he said.\n\nHe said his wife committing suicide or wandering off on medication was “not at the forefront of his mind”.\n\nThe trial will resume at 10am.\n\n3.55pm: Gerard Baden-Clay said his mistress Toni McHugh called him from the real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe agreed he told her his wife was missing.\n\nBaden-Clay said he phoned Ms McHugh the next day.\n\nHe said his lawyer had warned him the police would be investigating him because he was the spouse of a missing person.\n\n“I called her to simply forewarn her that might occur and tell her to tell the truth because my primary concern was to try and find Allison,” he said.\n\nCrown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC quipped: “Well, Toni McHugh had nothing to do with the disappearance of Allison?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “I don’t know.”\n\nThe accused said Ms McHugh contacted him after being “interrogated” by police and told of contact he had with other women.\n\nHe said he met with her face-to-face.\n\n“I told her that the relationship with Hammond had been before we got together and I told her the relationship with Crane, whilst it was while we were together, it was meaningless,” he said.\n\n“Because I was concerned about her and I just wanted her to be … not do anything silly.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know if Ms McHugh was still loyal to him.\n\nHe said he told her to find someone else and not for the first time.\n\nMr Fuller asked Baden-Clay about his mobile phone, describing it as his “life-blood” as a real estate agent.\n\n“Where was it when you picked it up in the morning of the 20th?” he asked.\n\nBaden-Clay said it was on the charger on his bedside table when he woke up.\n\nThe jury was shown a photo of his main bedroom, showing a bed and white bedspread with a blue throw, a coat hanger and a hair brush on it, as well as a treadmill near to the window and a lace curtain draped across it.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not tidy up the bedroom on the morning of April 20, 2012.\n\nAnother photo showed his white iPhone charger cord looped through a handle of his bedside drawer.\n\n“I didn’t put it on the charger, no,” he said.\n\n“I was asked previously as to whether at some ungodly hour in the middle of the night I put it on and I have no recollection of that.”\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife’s side of the bed was “sort of folded back”.\n\n“So it gave me an indication that it looked like she probably had been in bed at some point,” he said.\n\nThe accused said when he made the bed he would not have made it “like that”.\n\nHe said he thought someone else may have moved the doona cover.\n\nBaden-Clay said it was “hard to say” whether the bed looked slept in.\n\nThe accused took the jury through the bedroom photo by photo, pointing out his wife’s dressing table and their walk-in wardrobe.\n\nHe said he did not see his wife’s pyjamas when he woke up that morning.\n\n“Well the, the, I don’t know where her pyjamas were, they may have been in the laundry basket, I don’t know but her shoes were missing and one of the pairs of leggings she tended to wear when she went walking wasn’t there,” he said.\n\nHe said he did not connect his phone to the charger at 1.48am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he used his phone up until the last text messages he sent at roughly 8.30pm on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I don’t think I had my phone after that,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller suggested he did have his phone and he put it on the charger next to his bed.\n\nBaden-Clay: “I did not.”\n\nThe accused said he woke the next morning, took his phone off the charger and sat on the toilet.\n\nHe said he had not driven the Holden Captiva the previous night.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed they had only had the Captiva for about eight weeks at that time.\n\nHe agreed his wife had not complained of bleeding in the car or a chipped tooth.\n\n“No, I don’t remember that,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller suggested his wife had no plans to walk that morning.\n\n“Well, she did,” Baden-Clay replied.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife would have preferred to keep the phone after he went to bed.\n\nHe agreed he was rushing the next morning when he shaved.\n\nMr Fuller asked him how he injured his hand.\n\nBaden-Clay said the tip of the screwdriver going into his hand was what caused him to cut his hand a day earlier while fitting a light.\n\nMr Fuller: “I suggest what you did to your face was not a shaving injury.”\n\nBaden-Clay: “It was.”\n\nMr Fuller: “That came about when your wife scratched your face?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “She did not.”\n\nMr Fuller: “At a time when your wife was struggling with you?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No she did not.”\n\nHe agreed it was a significant injury to his face but said not everyone asked him about it.\n\n“Not everybody who saw me, but some people who saw me did,” he said of the marks on his cheek.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he had a problem with the plant Cat’s Claw at his house and there were Crepe Myrtle leaves in the backyard, which were falling at that time of year.\n\n3.30pm: The jury heard continued cross-examination of Gerard Baden-Clay by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC.\n\nHe asked Baden-Clay about the questions he and his wife spoke about at Mt Coot-tha on April 18, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he and his wife were probably away for half an hour, or maybe slightly longer.\n\nHe said they arrived home to learn his brother had a new baby boy.\n\nThe accused said the family was happy but he could not comment on his wife’s happiness because she went straight to bed.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he did not tell police about the conversation on April 18 because they had not asked him about it.\n\nMr Fuller suggested to Baden-Clay that would have been important to tell police.\n\nThe accused agreed he told police his wife had a past history of depression.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it was the furtherest thing on my mind, no,” he said.\n\nHe said he told police he did not know if his wife was still taking Zoloft.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he was asked if there was any indication the marriage would end and he told them, “I hope not”.\n\nHe agreed he went into the house with a police officer to talk about his extramarital affair.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed those conversations did not take place in front of his father, Nigel Baden-Clay.\n\n“At that point in time my primary concern was for Allison’s safety or whereabouts, I expected her to be walking in the door at any moment … at any moment I anticipated she would be back so no, I did not discuss the fact I had been in communication with Toni McHugh since September the year before, that’s correct,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he phoned Ms McHugh to ask her to tell the truth on April 20, 2012.\n\n“I wanted to know what Toni’s position was,” he said, adding that it was not his belief they were still involved.\n\nBaden-Clay told the court his wife never asked him how many people in his office knew about the affair.\n\nHe said Ms Baden-Clay did not ask him whether he would be able to “live with the guilt”.\n\nThe jury was shown another page from Ms Baden-Clay’s diary.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused to read the next line.\n\n“I couldn’t go back to her even if I wanted to,” he read aloud.\n\nHe said he did not know why his wife had written that.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife and her friend Kerry-Anne Walker went away together for her 40th birthday in 2008.\n\nMr Fuller took him to a line she had written near to her dot-point marked “40th birthday”, which read “4 weeks later started”.\n\n“I was never asked the question but she’s obviously referencing that’s when the affair started,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why his wife had written in her diary: “Why so mean?”\n\n“I don’t know and if she had been able to ask me that question she would have been able to expand upon that. We had recommenced our sexual relationship in about February that year after the best part of nine years with hardly any … and it was very awkward initially,” he said.\n\n“There were a couple of occasions at the beginning where Allison was very self-conscious and very self-aware of what we were doing and I think she thinks that I laughed at the underwear that she was wearing and that’s not true.”\n\nHe said he did not tell his wife she smelled.\n\n“Neither of us had a shower on one occasion and I said maybe we should have a shower and we smelled,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused whether those questions were asked on April 19, 2012.\n\n“That’s completely untrue,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nKEEP READING BELOW FOR FULL COVERAGE FROM DAY 13 OF THE BADEN-CLAY TRIAL\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nBaden-Clay asked him why it was necessary to go out to ask the questions.\n\n“It was something Allison wanted to do. She wanted to grab a coffee and go out,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused about his calls with mistress Ms McHugh on April 19, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed she usually called at that time, in the early evening or late afternoon, to avoid coming into contact with his wife.\n\nHe agreed he spoke to her for about 7 minutes.\n\nThe accused agreed Ms McHugh called him again around 5.15pm and the call lasted roughly 10 minutes.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed they spoke again for another 13 minutes at 5.25pm.\n\nHe said it was more or less one phone call.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed that meant they were speaking together for around half an hour.\n\n“Probably would have mentioned that, she would have been describing what she was doing. But as I discussed before the predominant part of that second conversation was her talking to me,” he said.\n\nThe accused said Ms McHugh spoke to him about starting a new job and he was keen to find out how it was going.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh would have called him earlier in the week, as well.\n\nBaden-Clay said it was not a major issue that Ms McHugh would be at the real estate conference with his wife.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh was aggressive on the phone and “lost it”.\n\nBaden-Clay said Ms McHugh yelled at him and suggested it was disrespectful he had not told either his wife or her they would both be at the conference.\n\n“That was part of how Toni reacted to certain things, she was quite volatile … so I anticipated she would … be prepared to deal with it if she happened to see her. She was volatile with me, I had no concerns with her being an issue towards Allison,” he said.\n\nThe accused agreed Ms McHugh wrote in an email on Monday, February 20, 2012 that she was angry and sick of taking a backseat to his relationship with his wife.\n\nBut Baden-Clay said he did not believe she was capable of being confrontational with his wife.\n\n“You understand, as I’ve just explained to you before, I had known her for a period of over four years and I knew she had these explosive moments and cooled down afterwards,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay maintained he did not believe there would be any risk if the two women in his life met one another at the conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said he did not tell his wife Ms McHugh would be at the conference because he did not want her to know he was still in contact with his mistress.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not intend to leave his wife for Ms McHugh, despite emails claiming he would do so being sent from his secret Bruce Overland account.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused why he was not afraid of Ms McHugh providing the emails to his wife.\n\nHe said it had not crossed his mind.\n\n“As I say, I don’t know how many times I can say it, it was not my concern there would be that issue,” he said.\n\n1.05pm: Gerard Baden-Clay said he did not regard himself as in a relationship with mistress Toni McHugh by April 19, 2012.\n\n“We hadn’t seen each other for a number of weeks at my urging because I was trying to assist her to end any idea she had that there was some sort of relationship with me or future with me,” he said.\n\n“I wanted her to be able to be the one to control the … to tell me where to go, basically.”\n\nMr Fuller: “Who was more important to you Mr Baden-Clay, your wife or Ms McHugh?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Allison, absolutely, Allison.”\n\nHe agreed he told counsellor Carmel Ritchie from the outset that his wife did not trust him.\n\nBaden-Clay said he told Ms Ritchie he was concerned about his wife “bringing up repeatedly painful things from the past”.\n\n“I felt that for Allison it was unhelpful for her to constantly revisit those things that were painful for her,” he said.\n\nHe said Ms Ritchie convinced him that it would be helpful, because she gave a structure to the process.\n\nHe said he did not agree to the counselling session just to placate his wife.\n\n“I wasn’t having an affair with Carmel Ritchie and I wasn’t having an affair with my wife,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he met Ms McHugh at a coffee shop and told her it was “too hard” to keep going as they were.\n\nHe said Ms McHugh pressed him to give a date for when he would leave the marriage.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told her he would be out of his marriage by July 1, 2012.\n\nMr Fuller asked Baden-Clay whether Ms McHugh gave him an “out” that day.\n\n“I do not recollect that, what I know, was that in order for her to move on, I felt it would be necessary for her to be the one to make the determination there was no future for us,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he had conversations with his wife about ending their marriage before seeing psychiatrist Dr Tom George in 2009.\n\nHe agreed he did not tell Dr George he wanted out of the marriage because his wife no longer slept with him.\n\n“I complained to him about the fact that Allison had been telling herself that she did not have depression, for many years, and that when she was forced to, for want of a better description, be capable … she would do that, but whenever I was around she didn’t seem to make any effort at all,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed there was tension between them about making decisions in the household.\n\nHe agreed he told Dr George he was frustrated by his wife’s level of dependence on him.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told the doctor he had some financial stress at the real estate agency and resented his wife purchasing an expensive treadmill.\n\nHe agreed he did not tell Dr George he was not having enough sex.\n\n“I never wanted to put pressure on Allison additionally on our sex life and one of the side-effects of her medication was a loss of libido and weight gain … it sounds pathetic,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could not remember his wife’s 40th birthday.\n\nMr Fuller asked him if he remembered writing about it in a blog in 2008.\n\n“I don’t recollect,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller read from the blog post, in which Baden-Clay wrote of trying to do the best impersonation of his wife, who had just turned 40, and was spending a week at the Golden Door Health Retreat.\n\nThe trial will resume at 2.30pm.\n\n12.40pm: Baden-Clay agreed he sold the Lexus and bought a Holden Captiva to save money as a result of financial challenges they were facing.\n\nHe agreed his family loaned him money, he loaned money from the bank and owed money to friends. Baden-Clay agreed he had to make a decision on who he would pay.\n\n“Everybody else,” he said when asked who he was paying interest to, other than his family, friends and Westpac bank.\n\nThe accused agreed he was paying out money for the purchase of the rent roll.\n\n“It wasn’t our main source of income but it was a significant source of income,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed property sales were up and down and he could not guarantee where the income would come from, as he would with the rent roll.\n\nHe agreed he wanted control of the business back.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed his friends loaned him $270,000 but loosened the reins when his wife stepped on board.\n\nHe agreed his wife asked him to make a choice when she found out about the affair with Toni McHugh in September, 2011.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed his wife came to the workplace as a general manager, restricted his meetings at night and he had to seek her permission before he went out.\n\n“She clearly thought what had happened between yourself and Toni McHugh was over,” Mr Fuller said.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct.\n\nHe said he went to see Ms McHugh at Christmas time out of a sense of responsibility to her.\n\nHe agreed he had lost some of his freedom.\n\n“In some ways, that was a relief for me,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nMr Fuller said the accused had previously had the best of both worlds: a family man with a wife at home and a lover at night.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not think Ms McHugh was vulnerable when he first counselled her through relationship problems in 2008.\n\n“There were a number of my staff with relationship issues… ,” he said.\n\nHe agreed he visited Ms McHugh at Bellbowrie for sex and at her unit at Toowong.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told his wife he took Ms McHugh to the movies and to dinner, as well as attended functions together.\n\nMr Fuller: “You kept your working life separate from your home life didn’t you? Up until Allison became part of the business?”\n\nHe said he responded to Ms McHugh’s love for him by agreeing to leave his wife for her.\n\n“The only time there was ever mentioned was this throw out of the first of July,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not remember talking to Ms McHugh about the type of car they would buy, as she had three sons.\n\nMr Fuller asked him if he planned to be a sort of “Brady bunch”.\n\nThe jury was shown an email from Ms McHugh to the Bruce Overland account, in which she wrote of looking for rental properties and moving in together.\n\n“She was constantly trying to put additional pressure on me, that’s correct,” he said of Ms McHugh.\n\nHe agreed she wanted him to leave his life.\n\n“She said in this very chair and told you that she didn’t believe me when I made that commitment because we’d had those conversations before and I had consistently demonstrated my lack of willingness to leave my wife Allison,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nHe said he told his wife he loved Ms McHugh.\n\nThe jury was shown Allison Baden-Clay’s journal page in which she wrote down questions for her husband on April 18, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was reluctant to talk about the affair, but that did not mean he had not spoken about it at all.\n\n“I was having the conversations with Allison,” he said.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh had come to see him at his home in Brookfield on two occasions, while his family was away on the Gold Coast.\n\nBaden-Clay said he had told his wife about that.\n\n“When she asked me about it previously,” he said.\n\nHe said his wife had no issue with sleeping at the house knowing that Ms McHugh had been there, but did not want to use the Prado where they had sex.\n\nHe said he could not remember when he first told his wife he did not love her.\n\n“The conversations that we had were, I’m, please forgive me, I’m just trying to recollect for you… I’m trying to see if I can think if I can give a reference in time, I think it must have been in 2009 perhaps when we first went to see Tom George and we had a few conversations around then,” he said.\n\nHe agreed he thought that was around June, 2009.\n\n“We agreed to go together and it was after conversations with Dr George that we had further discussions with Allison that I still loved her but didn’t feel ‘in love’ with her,” he said.\n\nHe agreed he may have told Ms McHugh he didn’t love his wife, but just to “placate her”.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could not remember telling Ms McHugh he wanted to leave his wife but wasn’t ready yet in December, 2011.\n\n“I was trying to bring her back from the upset she had felt,” he said.\n\nHe agreed the way to make her feel better was by telling her he loved her.\n\nThe accused agreed he told Ms McHugh he would be hers “unconditionally” at the meeting.\n\n“It was a bit of a joke in relation to a real estate contract being unconditional and I think Toni raised that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not treat the words “unconditionally” as a joke.\n\nThe accused agreed he told her he wanted to leave his wife and be with her unconditionally.\n\nHe agreed there was contact between them from that moment on, on some occasions “quite regular”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed they phoned, used the Bruce Overland account and sometimes met.\n\nHe agreed that was difficult under the new regime his wife imposed.\n\nMr Fuller: “So you effectively had stolen moments with her?”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed.\n\nHe could not say why he had sex with Ms McHugh.\n\n“One occasion was after we had met at a coffee shop and when we went back to our cars, to leave, I sat in her car and talked with her for a little bit longer and… how much sordid detail?,” he said.\n\n“It wasn’t sex as in intercourse… I don’t know if I can answer that question.”\n\n11.50am: Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC has commenced his cross-examination of accused killer Gerard Baden-Clay.\n\nBaden-Clay, 43, has pleaded not guilty in the Supreme Court at Brisbane to the murder of his wife Allison on April 19, 2012.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused if he deceived his wife for four years.\n\n“Yes, I did,” he said.\n\nBut Fuller said it started earlier than that, with an affair with Michelle Hammond.\n\nHe agreed he led his wife to believe he chose her over Toni McHugh.\n\n“You let her believe right up until April 2012 that Toni McHugh was a thing of the past, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Correct.”\n\nMr Fuller said his wife was not the only one he was deceiving.\n\n“No, she was not,” the accused said, referring to his deceit of Ms McHugh.\n\nThe jury was shown an email from Baden-Clay to Ms McHugh where he promised to separate from his wife by July 1, 2012.\n\n“Throughout that time she had been working at your relationship, taking you to counsellors and behind her back this is the message you are sending to Toni McHugh?,” Mr Fuller asked.\n\nBaden-Clay: “That’s correct.”\n\nThe accused said Ms McHugh had built a fantasy around them being together.\n\n“As I indicated to her before I often said to her things to placate her, told her things she wanted to hear,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nHe said he hoped by telling Ms McHugh in an email on April 11, 2012 “it was agony for me, too. I love you” that it would “calm her down”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told Ms McHugh those things for the sake of the business, because he was concerned for her and out of a desire to continue the sexual relationship.\n\nMr Fuller asked Baden-Clay why he was still seeing Ms McHugh in April, 2012.\n\n“She’s conversing with me and I was trying to placate her,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he deceived Ms McHugh in December, 2011 when he told her he wanted to get back with her.\n\nHe said he agreed he gave Ms McHugh a date of July 1, 2012 when they would be together.\n\nMr Fuller: “Which happens to be your wife’s birthday?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Which happens to be today.”\n\nThe accused disagreed Ms McHugh gave him an out during a meeting at a coffee shop.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could live without Ms McHugh.\n\nHe said he told her he loved her out of concern for her.\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had also deceived his friends and family by letting them believe he was in a successful relationship with a growing business.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he did not want to jeopardise his family.\n\n11.20am: Gerard Baden-Clay told the jury he returned home to the family’s property at Brookfield Rd to meet police.\n\nThe jury was taken to a phone call from the Baden-Clay home phone to his wife’s mobile phone at 8.48am.\n\nHe said police arrived at the home about 8am but he couldn’t remember the time exactly.\n\nThe jury saw phone calls from the Brookfield State School to Olivia Walton and a call from employee Kate Rankin to the accused telling him she would work from the office rather than attend the conference, in light of Allison Baden-Clay’s disappearance.\n\nBaden-Clay said he called his friends Fiona and Stuart Christ to “put them on notice” his wife was missing as it might have changed their evening plans in terms of the children’s sleepovers.\n\nHe said he phoned his wife’s father Geoff Dickie at 9.51am.\n\nThe accused said he tried to call his friend Robert Cheesman and when he couldn’t get through, phoned his wife Katie; Peter Cranna and his wife’s best friend from school Kerry-Anne Walker.\n\nHe said he phoned the school principal to check on his daughters.\n\nBaden-Clay said he lived at the rented property on Brookfield Rd for about five years.\n\nThe jury was shown a to-scale plan of the family home.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed there was a bedroom, ensuite and walk-in robe at the front of the house, next to the family room and the entry stairwell at the front of the house.\n\nHe said his wife slept on the right side of the bed and he on the left.\n\nThe accused agreed there were three bedrooms on the right-hand side of the house, next to the front entry stairs leading up from the driveway.\n\nHe said his middle daughter slept in the room near to the backyard and the paved alfresco at the rear of the home, while his eldest daughter slept above the carport and the youngest nearest to the front door entry, also facing the road.\n\nBaden-Clay said his eldest daughter slept on a raised bed and used steps to get in it.\n\nHe said his eldest and youngest daughter had windows in their bedrooms that overlooked the car port while each room was situated directly above the garage.\n\nThe accused said the family’s Holden Captiva was parked in the carport nose-in by his wife on April 19, 2012.\n\nHe said he reversed it into the carport after heading out to look for his wife on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay took the jury through a plan of the underneath of his family home on Brookfield Rd, including an underground storage area, garage and carport.\n\nThe jury was shown an aerial map of the Brookfield area and the accused pointed to his home and the location of Brookfield Rd.\n\nHe showed the jury where his wife would usually walk in the mornings.\n\n“The two main routes that she took were, one that I described as around the school … when Allison would do her walk around the school and she would either go clockwise or anti-clockwise, it would change, and she would go around that block,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife would go past the produce shop to Rafting Ground Rd, then connect with Boscombe Rd back past the school and home.\n\nHe said the second route went along Brookfield Rd, to the roundabout and Gold Creek Rd, all the way to the aged care home and back.\n\nHe said his sister looked for his wife along those routes on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he contacted a life insurance company on May 1, 2012 to determine how he could make a claim.\n\n“The day before we had found Allison’s body and we knew it had been confirmed that it was her and Dad told me I really had an obligation to the insurers to let them know, that was why I made the call,” he said.\n\nHe said he did not fill out the claim form himself.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed no payments were made on a Westpac credit card owned by the pair between January 24 and May 30, 2012. A minimum payment of $2426 was required.\n\n“Allison and I made the determination that any excess funds of income that we had needed to be focused on the other debts and priorities in the business and that (card) for us was not the priority,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said his relationship with his wife was good on the night of April 19, 2012.\n\nHe said he was not under financial pressure or significant relationship pressure that night.\n\n“Allison and I were working together very well on both our relationship and the business, and financially the business was turning around and we were moving forward as we were getting better,” he said.\n\nHe said he had no plans to leave his marriage for Toni McHugh.\n\n“That’s absolutely untrue,” he said.\n\n“My intention was to end any relationship with Toni McHugh and solidify and continue to rebuild the relationship with Allison for our future together.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he was not concerned Ms McHugh and his wife might meet at a real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\n“No. I didn’t have concerns about it,” he said.\n\n“Allison was not a confrontational sort of a person, they were at a corporate function and I didn’t anticipate or have any concerns, it didn’t enter my mind as to being a concern that they were going to see each other there.”\n\nThe accused finished his evidence-in-chief.\n\n10.30am: The jury continued to be taken through phone records on April 19 and 20, 2012.\n\nGerard Baden-Clay said his wife likely called her hairdresser to tell her she was on her way at 4.38pm on April 19.\n\nBaden-Clay said he would have shortly after called his mother to let her know he had finished parent-teacher interviews and she may have asked him to pick up some sausages for dinner.\n\nHe said a call from a recruitment company calling him for a reference for an ex staff member at 4.57pm.\n\nThe accused said another call was likely his wife “touching base” to let him know she had made her hairdressing appointment.\n\nHe said Toni McHugh called him and it was during that conversation he told her his wife would be attending the same real estate conference as her the next day.\n\n“That conversation, I can’t remember all of the details of it, but Toni was not pleased about the fact Allison was going to be at the conference the following day and I basically didn’t say very much and really didn’t respond to that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he had no real concern about the two women attending the same conference along with hundreds of others.\n\nHe said, as an aside, his wife was not a “confrontational” person.\n\n“There was no guarantee they were even going to see each other so I had no concerns about that, I mentioned it, I think Toni said to me in that conversation that she was going the following day and I said: ‘Oh, well, Allison’s going too’,” he said.\n\nThe accused said two calls he made at 5.10pm and 5.11pm may have been in relation to an office matter.\n\nHe said Ms McHugh called him again.\n\n“Toni was upset about it, she didn’t want to see Allison and she was expressing her displeasure about it.\n\n“She asked me to tell Allison that she was going to be there, which I never agreed to and certainly I never did, and for the majority of that it was her doing the talking and me not saying much at all,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why Ms McHugh wanted him to tell his wife she would be at the conference the next day.\n\nHe said he had no intention of telling his wife such a thing.\n\n“Whilst I was communicating with Toni, Allison did not know that, so I didn’t want to open a can of worms by explaining to Allison that I was still speaking to Toni and the other thing was, I just wasn’t very concerned,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he deleted Ms McHugh’s phone calls from his phone history.\n\nThe accused said his wife called their home phone just before 6.30pm, shortly after calling Baden-Clay on his mobile.\n\nHe said his wife told him she had finished her hair appointment and was heading home.\n\nBaden-Clay said he received a text message from a staff member to inform him she had sold a property or secured a new listing at 7.42pm.\n\nHe said he texted her back to say something like “congratulations, well done, you’re a legend”.\n\nThe accused said he sent a group message to the rest of the sales team as well, as part of a regular team building exercise, to share the news of the property sale.\n\nHe said there was a text message from his sister Olivia Walton to his wife at 8.16pm.\n\n“I suspect that was Olivia texting Al about plans for the sleepover the following night and probably asking Al to give her a call because Olivia’s mobile phone plan allowed her to make phone calls but not text messages or something like that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he sent another group text message to his business team spruiking his wife’s successes at the training session she had that day at 8.22pm.\n\n“It was just a little team building thing that I had and as each stage of a sale or a property management progresses I would give them a little pep,” he said.\n\nHe said he would have been doing the ironing at home by that time.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife would have phoned his sister at 8.28pm but they had poor phone reception so the call dropped out.\n\nHe said his wife phoned back from the home phone.\n\nThe jury was taken to a phone call from Baden-Clay to his wife 6.32am on April 20, 2012.\n\n“That’s the first phone call I made to Al to ask where she was,” he said.\n\nHe said the call went to his wife’s answering service and he left a message.\n\nThe jury was shown another call he made to his wife at 6.38am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he used his home phone to call his mother.\n\n“I thought about calling mum and dad and I didn’t, I hung up,” he said, his voice breaking.\n\nThe jury was shown another call from the accused to his wife’s mobile at 6.45am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he called his parents and told them his wife was gone and he didn’t know where she was.\n\nHe agreed he tried to phone Sgt Murray Watson at Indooroopilly police.\n\n“I had his number in my phone so I tried giving him a call … and it went through to a standardised voice mail,” he said.\n\n“I didn’t realise it was the Indooroopilly Police Station I had in my phone and so, I just hung up.”\n\nHe said his sister texted him and he called her back.\n\n“She just called to say … ‘I’m in the car, where does Al normally walk? What routes does she take?’ And that’s when I told her and she said ‘righto, I’ll go there straight away’,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he phoned his wife again at 7.02am.\n\n“I kept getting her voicemail and you can see they were very short calls, so I probably just said ‘please call, please’ or something like that,” he said.\n\nHe said he kept calling because he thought the noise of the phone would attract her attention more.\n\nThe accused said either his father or his daughters made a call from the home phone at Brookfield to his wife’s mobile.\n\n“Pretty much as soon as Dad got home, I don’t know exactly when that would have been, but it would have been around 7am because he called at 6.56am and he was on his way,” he said.\n\n“I basically, when he arrived, I went out pretty much straight away.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he called his sister and they updated one another on what was happening.\n\nHe said his sister asked him what his wife was wearing.\n\n“She was just telling me where she’d been so I could make sure I wasn’t, you know, we weren’t sort of crossing over each other’s search areas, that we were doubling up,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he sent a text to his wife’s mobile and then made a call to his staff member Kate Rankin, who had planned to attend the real estate conference with his wife that day.\n\n“I tried to call Kate just to find out what their plans were for the day, and it appears as though I didn’t get through to her and then she’s called me straight back,” he said.\n\n“I wondered if maybe Al had just walked to her house or something.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he called his sister again and asked her if she thought it was too early to phone police.\n\nHe said he first dialled Police Link then, growing impatient with the automated voiceover, called 000.\n\n“I still didn’t think it was an emergency situation so I just called that general number … and it seemed to be going on forever and … then I called the emergency number,” he said, sobbing and then blowing his nose loudly.\n\nOn day 12, Baden-Clay declared in court that his extra-marital affairs with three women were “just sex’’.\n\nHe told of embarking on the affairs after his wife became depressed, lost her sex drive and put on weight.\n\nHe said he continued sleeping with his long-term mistress, Toni McHugh, for the “sake of the business’’, because he feared what she would do if they split.\n\nBaden-Clay said he still loved his wife and was committed to repairing their marriage when she vanished in April 2012.\n\nHe cried as he said: “I just wanted sex.’’\n\nBaden-Clay’s testimony covered years of infidelity, including his three-year affair with Ms McHugh, a saleswoman in his western suburbs real estate office.\n\nHe portrayed Ms McHugh as the one doing the pursuing and that he grew to want her to “preferably go away’’.\n\nUnderlining his point, he told the court of a confrontation he’d once had with his business partners about Ms McHugh.\n\n“I admitted to them that there were occasions when I was effectively sleeping with Toni for the sake of the business,’’ he said.\n\n“I didn’t want her to leave the business and I didn’t want her to cause any dramas.’’\n\nHe said his comments were passed on to Ms McHugh, who was “justifiably very unhappy’’ and the affair went into a hiatus.\n\n“We got back together … for the sake of the business.’’\n\nHe was telling Ms McHugh what she wanted to hear when he promised her in an April email that he would leave his wife by July 1, 2012, he said.\n\nRepeatedly breaking down, Baden-Clay sobbed as he was asked to recall the day his wife found out about the affair with Ms McHugh.\n\nHe said Allison had phoned him in September 2011 and said they needed to talk, and he realised she must have discovered the affair with Ms McHugh.\n\nThey drove separately to a McDonald’s restaurant and he got in the passenger seat of her Prado and admitted to the affair.\n\n“She was just in shock. She didn’t yell or shout or scream or anything, that’s just not Al.\n\n“She got out of the car. She sat on the little concrete kerb … she was just shaking her head, had her head in her hands.”\n\nHe said she had asked if he loved Ms McHugh, and he said he didn’t. There was an ultimatum – choose his wife or his mistress.\n\n“It was just an absolute a no-brainer for me,” he said.\n\nHe told how an angry Ms McHugh had yelled and thrown things at him when he broke up with her.\n\n“She called me all sorts of names, said I was the scum of the earth, that I ruined three years of her life,’’ he said.\n\nTweets by @TheMurrayD \n\nThree months later, after a meeting at a coffee shop in December 2011, he said he got back with Ms McHugh. They were last intimate in about January or February.\n\nBaden-Clay said the affair with Ms McHugh started in the office one night in August 2008, when they were working back late.\n\nHe’d go home for “happy hour’’ with his children, then would leave to meet with Ms McHugh for trysts in the family’s Prado, Snowy.\n\nAfter Allison discovered the affair, she refused to drive the Prado.\n\nThere had been other affairs too. One, with another colleague from his first office, started in about 2006 and lasted for a month.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife had lost her libido and put on weight after taking anti-depression medication.\n\n“Allison and I hadn’t had any physical intimacy for years,” he said.\n\nHe said an affair with a third woman was a one-night fling in Sydney. Despite the affairs, he said he would never have left Allison. Of his longest affair, with Ms McHugh, he said “for me it was just a physical relationship.\n\n","byline":"David Murray ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T06:41:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:42:53.000Z","description":"IT is day 13 of the trial of former Brookfield real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, who stands accused of murdering his wife Allison Baden-Clay, 43, on April 19, 2012.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v71-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v70-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6u-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnii5v6y-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"1e87eac055999d5768d5633379e2c591","keywords":["passenger seat","anti-depression medication","long-term mistress","wanted sex","concrete kerb","three-year affair","business partners","physical relationship","coffee shop","physical intimacy","thrown things","one-night fling","Allison Baden-Clay","Toni McHugh","real estate","Murder accused","extra-marital affairs","real estate office","suburbs real estate","western suburbs","Accused murderer","Brisbane","Queensland","Australia","Sydney","New South Wales","Supreme Court","Sir David Murray"],"kicker":"Murder trial","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/day-13-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnihsrf2-1226972945594?sv=5e78d5620d8678d8239c5a700a2a695f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972945594","originalAssetId":"1226972945594","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"814c5d32e0a1b3550fae76a50ef91e0c","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"djNnVpbjpYofoeV5Ndi65kZOqqB2Fzmn","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"814c5d32e0a1b3550fae76a50ef91e0c","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"djNnVpbjpYofoeV5Ndi65kZOqqB2Fzmn","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THEY are Allison Baden-Clay’s private thoughts and feelings, revealed in diary entries tendered to the court.

He’d spent 10 days in camp with the Maroons and trained in every position, except halfback.\n\nThe Maroons happily enjoyed at least one night of traditional “bonding” each camp and, in a move that could easily be perceived as arrogance, visited Dreamworld theme park just 48 hours before the first game.\n\nThey then got beaten on home soil and it was a result that nobody saw coming.\n\nMove ahead to game two and the preparation was diabolical.\n\nThree players under injury clouds, a 22-man squad named and question marks from start to finish.\n\nCherry-Evans carried a knee injury all camp and didn’t train with the team until a 60-minute session on match eve.\n\nSo, once again, the Maroons had a halfback guiding them around Origin that was nowhere to be heard for almost the entire camp.\n\nThe result, Cherry-Evans had just 27 touches of the ball – about 40 per cent less than he does at NRL level – and the Maroons failed to cross the stripe.\n\nWhich brings us to game three where once again Meninga has rolled the dice on three players – Cooper Cronk, Corey Parker and Matt Gillett.\n\nCronk has not played since May 27 with a broken arm, Parker since June 9 with a fractured cheekbone and Gillett since June 21 with a shoulder problem.\n\nMedically there is no reason why all three can’t play, but surely the gap in between games for Cronk, and to a lesser extent Parker, is cause for concern.\n\nThis is rugby league at its highest level. The Blues are no mugs, they’re the 2014 Origin champions and they’ve proven to be the toughest defensive nut to crack in history.\n\nThe Maroons argue to the death that they’ve not suffered any complacency in their quest to win nine, but when your preparation is not perfect and you’re willing to accept anything less than perfect then surely that’s a sign that standards and expectations are slipping.\n\nAnd that is the most worrying thing for the Maroons.\n\n","byline":"Todd Balym ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/NRL News/State of Origin -

(the girl) has made a good recovery,’’ she said.\n\nDuring an interview with police the mum initially tried to blame the poisoning on her own father, but later admitted she did it to seek attention for herself.\n\nThe mother chronicled her sick daughter’s so-called fight for life on a Facebook page which had more than 8000 supporters and raised an estimated $500 in cash donations.\n\nLegal Aid barrister Catherine Morgan, for the mum, said her client had been assessed as having a rare, but medically recognised condition known as Factitious Disorder by Proxy — which in only severe cases is referred to as Munchausen’s by Proxy.\n\nPrior to inflicting harm on the child the mum’s friends and family considered her to be a perfect parent, the court was told.\n\n“There was nothing to suggest she was anything other than a model mum,’’ Ms Morgan said.\n\n“(Sadly) she inflicted the worst of all punishments on herself ... because one day she will have to explain to her daughter (what she did and why).\n\n“She is going to live the rest of her life knowing what she did (to her child).’’\n\nThe court was told the girl, now aged five, and her brother, four, are now being cared for by extended family.\n\nJudge Rafter, in his sentencing remarks, said: “Your betrayal of your daughter’s trust is incomprehensible.’’\n\n“You must have been aware of the serious harm you were causing to your daughter.\n\n“Your conduct was intended to make your daughter unwell for the purpose of attracting attention for yourself.’’\n\n","byline":"Tony Keim

the man behind the Fitzgerald Inquiry but yesterday said the details of the discussion would be private.\n\n“We’re going to have a meeting and a cup of tea and I look forward to that,” Mr Seeney said.\n\n“But can I tell you it’s not going to be a circus, it’s not a stunt. This is something that’s personal to me and it will be a personal meeting.\n\nCORRUPTION BUSTER: Fitzgerald warns of power abuse \n\n“I’ve never met Tony Fitzgerald. I don’t take his criticisms lightly and I’m looking forward to having a discussion with him.”\n\nIt comes as Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk used the looming 25th anniversary of the Fitzgerald Inquiry report to announce a new accountability policy. She said Labor would repeal the Newman Government’s contentious changes to the state’s corruption watchdog and election donation rules should it regain office.\n\nWith a copy of the Fitzgerald Inquiry report as a prop, Ms Palaszczuk highlighted some of Mr Fitzgerald’s criticisms of the Government before announcing the changes.\n\nThey include repealing the donation declaration cap changes, which lifted the cap from $1000 to $12,400.\n\nMs Palaszczuk said a Labor government would also sack the next chair and CEO of the state’s ­corruption watchdog if they did not have bipartisan support.\n\n“In government Labor will commence a new, fresh recruitment process for the chair and the CEO of the corruption watchdog,” Ms Palaszczuk said during one of her first major policy announcements in the lead-up to the next election.\n\n“So I am putting the LNP on notice: You can go ahead with your selection process but we will axe that process and we will start again.”\n\nMs Palaszczuk said Labor would also make its changes to the donation rules retrospective, meaning donations of $1000 or more received in the lead-up to the Stafford by-election and state election would have to be declared next year.\n\nThe Opposition’s accountability policy did not, however, touch on whether Labor would repeal the Newman Government’s decision to again make it illegal to lie to Parliament, an offence that was wiped by the Beattie government in 2006 after then-minister Gordon Nuttall was accused of lying to a parliamentary estimates committee.\n\nMr Seeney yesterday dismissed the policy and called on the Opposition to formulate one on “the things that really matter to Queenslanders”.\n\n","byline":"Sarah Vogler

licence. If she was to trade she would face prosecution under a regime that began today.\n\nThe amateur bodybuilder was given drug diversion over alleged cannabis and remains under investigation over the steroids, for which her tattooist partner was charged with illegal importation, police said.\n\nRaids in total found two unlicensed handguns and two rifles, cannabis, steroids, ecstasy, MHDA, synthetic amphetamines, hundreds of steroid tablets, capsules and powder, $11,000 cash and drug paraphernalia.\n\nNine people in all were arrested on 22 charges.\n\nDetective Inspector Brendan Smith of gang squad Maxima said a police strategy was to “target (bikies’ drug) networks because obviously if the customers are getting smashed, it makes life harder for them”.\n\nHe said police would give tattoo licence applicants a grace period while the Office of Fair Trading made their determinations amid “a large rush of applications coming in”.\n\n“But if you haven’t applied, you’re liable to prosecution,” he said.\n\nDet Insp Smith said the licensing regime — which requires every tattooist and parlour owner to be fingerprinted — would be used by police as “another tool” against outlaw motorcycle gangs.\n\nMore news...\n\n‘THIS BEACH IS OURS’ - RESIDENTS FENCE OTHERS OUT \n\nHOMEOWNERS on an exclusive strip have taken the extraordinary step of fencing off parts of the beach.

Any Tamils there, including those who left Sri Lanka, are safe and do not need to flee to Australia.\n\nSo this boatload of alleged “asylum seekers” actually seems part of a vast movement of people travelling from poor countries to rich ones in the West in search of wealth and the Abbott Government is right to try to negotiate their instant return.\n\nBOATLOAD: Reports Tamils handed over to Sri Lanka \n\nCOVER-UP: Greens query sick boat people whereabouts \n\nThe Government is even more correct to be militant in stopping boats. Around the world, Western countries are finding their borders under siege from poor immigrants like never before – well, not since the cataclysmic migration of German tribes into the Roman empire.\n\nThe United States now has more than 25,000 Latinos illegally crossing over every month, twice the rate of last year. It already has about 11 million undocumented or illegal immigrants, mostly Latinos, likely to form another underclass.\n\nIt is a similar story in Europe, which had 103,000 people illegally enter last year, many fleeing violence in Syria, Somalia, and elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nItaly last weekend intercepted another 5000 migrants sailing over from North Africa, bringing the total so far this year to more than 60,000.\n\nThat rate of arrivals is double that in 2011, when a record 63,000 Africans sailed over, many fleeing the violence of the Arab Spring. Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano estimates between 400,000 and 600,000 more are waiting to cross over from increasingly lawless Libya.\n\nEven flat-broke Greece has seen 3000 illegal immigrants from the Third World arrive each month. That’s twice the rate of a year ago, even though Greece built a wall to stop them coming through Turkey. At the other end of Europe, Spanish police last Sunday fought off 500 African migrants trying to break through the iron fence Spain built around Melilla, its semi-autonomous region in northeast Morocco.\n\nWhat makes this invasion of Europe even more alarming is that the vast majority of the immigrants are Muslim, when so many immigrant Muslim communities are already dangerously alienated.\n\nGot something to say to Andrew Bolt? Leave a comment below\n\nWhat’s more, Europe and the US now find their kindness exploited with scary results.\n\nIn 2008, then-president George W. Bush signed a law unanimously passed by Congress decreeing that children from Central America crossing US borders could not be sent back.\n\nThey had to held humanely until the courts released them to a “suitable family member” in the US or placed them in an Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program.\n\nThe result? An astonishing 50,000 unaccompanied children, most from Honduras, El Salvador or Nicaragua, have now crossed into the US since last October.\n\nJoining them have been thousands of single mothers with children, who are merely given a “notice to appear” in an immigration court before being dropped off at a bus station to go to wherever in the US they want. Few show up for their hearing.\n\nMuch the same has happened in Italy.\n\nThis year 5000 unaccompanied children as young as 11 have sailed across from Africa. Italy, unable to send them back, just encourages more.\n\nWe’ve seen this in Australia, too. In October 2010 the Gillard government promised children who’d sailed here illegally would be moved out of detention and into community-based accommodation.\n\nWithin three years we had five times more children in government care and scores had drowned trying to get here. Total arrivals meanwhile soared to 3000 people a month.\n\nThese are some of the lessons so far of asylum seeker policy. But have the Greens and their media sympathisers learned?\n\nGreens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young is already using the 30 children on the last Tamil boat as hostages in a game of moral blackmail.\n\n“I am extremely concerned about the children who were on this boat,” she protested with her usual sanctimony.\n\n“We shouldn’t be deporting these people, we should be assessing their claims here in Australia.”\n\nMeanwhile,  online publishes “heart wrenching drawings” sent by children in detention centres, claiming they raise “further concerns about the treatment of the young detainees”.\n\nLet them free, is the message. And if the US and Italy are any guide, we’ll soon see boats loaded with yet more children to smash our resolve.\n\nPopulations are on the move. Time for honesty from the Left: how many millions do we really want and how will they change this country?\n\nAndrew Bolt blogs at blogs.news. com.au/couriermail/andrewbolt\n\n","byline":"Andrew Bolt ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM Opinion/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T08:58:20.000Z","description":"THE Greens this week proved they’ve learnt nothing about asylum seekers and the lethal cost of “kindness” to them – particularly children.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/opinion-the-west-is-being-swamped-by-poor-men-women-and-children-and-abbott-is-doing-us-a-favour-sending-them-back/story-fnihsr9v-1226975562182?sv=d3161aa7df2fcf09de59892dba0e7264","name":"couriermail.com.au"}],"domains":["couriermail.com.au"],"id":"449be73fa9960decc3d6dd1c5e648c1a","keywords":["illegal immigrants","asylum seekers","Greens immigration spokeswoman","immigration court","detention centres","bus station","suitable family member","asylum seeker policy","people travelling","media sympathisers","German tribes","Australia","African migrants","United States of America","Sri Lanka","Italy","Syria","Morocco","El Salvador","Somalia","India","Honduras","George W.

Grayson, Director-General of the Department of Premier and Cabinet.\n\nDENIAL: Notes show Qld link to AWH \n\nDEALINGS: Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale orders review of campaign\n\nThe meeting was attended by Mr Grayson – who at the time was in business with controversial company Australian Water Holdings – AWH’s state director Wayne Myers, then-Ipswich CEO Carl Wulff and a senior bureaucrat. Mr Grayson denies any wrong-doing or conflict of interest.\n\nAWH is being investigated by a corruption inquiry in NSW. The inquiry has made no corruption allegations against any Queenslander or Queensland company.\n\nThe meeting is now under scrutiny after The Courier-Mail revealed it was set up to discuss Ipswich’s Ripley Valley development and raised a business plan by AWH. This contrasts to statements by the council in April that the meeting “was for the express purpose” of discussing Boeing’s planned withdrawal from Ipswich.\n\nBut a Government briefing paper prepared before the meeting concentrates on the “Ripley Valley Urban Development Area” and mentions “water, sewage and roads”.\n\nAs revealed by The Courier-Mail yesterday, handwritten notes from the meeting also spelled out the words “Ripley” and “Australian Water”. The only documented reference to Boeing from the meeting was a short handwritten note.\n\nAsked about the discrepancy from its original answers about the meeting not being about AWH, council said it was “clear that the Boeing matter was discussed”.\n\n“While Ripley Valley and AWH may have been discussed, what is also clear is that Ipswich City Council never entered into any arrangement with AWH,” a spokesman said.\n\nCouncil has been trying to distance itself from AWH – with Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale saying the company was clearly told in 2011 that it was not getting work with Ipswich.\n\nCr Pisasale met AWH boss Nick Di Girolamo in 2012, but he says it was in Mr Di Giralomo’s capacity as head of the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and did not involve lobbying about AWH.\n\n","byline":"Liam Walsh, Kelmeny Fraser ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/couriermail.com.au/CourierMail/CM Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T11:20:38.000Z","description":"A HANDWRITTEN scrawl has contradicted a council’s explanation of a controversial top-level meeting involving a company at the centre of a corruption inquiry.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnii5v71-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnihsrf2-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnii5v70-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnii5v6u-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnii5v6y-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"3a5a9c3f0ad739ca385f132612b423d4","keywords":["highlights meeting discrepancy","meeting concentrates","note highlights meeting","controversial company Australian","dodgy mining deal","Government briefing paper","corruption inquiry","controversial top-level meeting","faces scrutiny","business plan","Carl Wulff","Wayne Myers","Nick Di Girolamo","Jon Grayson"],"kicker":"Council explanation","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/council-reply-faces-scrutiny-as-note-highlights-meeting-discrepancy/story-fnihsrf2-1226975677573?sv=c364e088f1fd8f115dfed467ce39ac0b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975677573","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/CourierMail/CM QLD News and Photos/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"116f7406e7f2007e0a21f9691eda001e","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"EwMGV2OTpFu7CMj4Zit5oAKeT374UCLC","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"13231c16feaa29d026705354b94e35d6","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975675825","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A HANDWRITTEN scrawl has contradicted a council’s explanation of a controversial top-level meeting involving a company at the centre of a corruption inquiry.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Council reply faces scrutiny as note highlights meeting discrepancy","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Council reply faces scrutiny","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"18696988-01d7-11e4-8a13-c9890f82f8cd -

All the seats were taken, except one.\n\nThree Aboriginal men were sitting in a four-berth seat by the door, where most people were crowded around. I hesitated for a second, to make sure nobody else was heading for the seat, and then walked through the standing passengers and asked if the seat was being used.\n\nThe men, having been sitting quietly, suddenly perked up and the man sitting next to the empty seat smiled and said, “No, you can sit here, please”. So I did.\n\nTo begin with, the men were quiet and respectful and didn’t talk or look at me. I could sense some discomfort so I made a comment about how cold it was. This was met with more smiles and nods of agreement.\n\nVIDEO: Vile racist rant on Sydney train \n\nA minute or so later one of the men broke the ice by asking me what the time was, and when I thought the train would be leaving. Soon we were talking about all sorts of things.\n\nWe discussed the footy (they were supporting the wrong team), arguing about the cricket (you can’t go for the West Indies having just left Adelaide Oval), and laughing about netball — the oldest man’s wife loves it and we all agreed it is terrible.\n\nWe also discovered how many of the same places we had visited. They come from Alice Springs and I have travelled as far north as Pukatja and the surrounding towns. We discussed donkeys and camels and what I had been doing there — in 2005 I had travelled up with a rock band to take live music to the APY communities.\n\nAs the men reached their destination, they stood up and called out goodbyes and waved to the other passengers. The oldest man said ‘‘God bless you mob’’ before exiting the carriage. As the doors closed I waved one last time to the last guy saying, ‘‘See ya sis’’, and from behind me I heard the words, ‘‘Thank God”.\n\nI thought for a second, decided to ignore the comment, and started to put in my headphones. Then I was tapped on the shoulder, and a comment was made along the lines of ‘‘Bet you’re relieved — those people really shouldn’t be allowed to drink!’’, followed by nervous giggling.\n\nI turned to see a group of women sitting in the seats behind me, looking concerned and sympathetic. I removed the earphone, took a deep breath, and launched quietly into speech along the following lines:\n\n“Excuse me! Those men were the friendliest, most polite people I have sat with on a train in years. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting with them and it completely sucks that when they got off, I was left sitting on a train amid a bunch of rude women, surrounded by an entire train full of white people who I am sure represent the very destruction of the traditional home of those men.\n\n“Yet if anyone on the train had made the effort to speak to or even look at one of these blokes, they would have been treated with respect and friendliness.\n\n“As for the alcohol you believed you could smell on them, yes, they have been at the football and had a couple of drinks, as did you obviously, but the alcohol you can smell is from me. I served hundreds of people today and am covered in beer and wine.\n\n“Don’t you dare even think about responding to me right now, you disgust me and should be ashamed of yourselves”.\n\nA small section of the carriage near us applauded quietly. One of the women cried, and the majority pretended they weren’t even on the train and had heard nothing. Maybe they didn’t. But they will now.\n\n■ ■ ■ ■\n\nMy mother grew up along the South Australian section of The Ghan train line. My family has travelled extensively through the Outback on holidays as children and teenagers, and I was brought up to be aware of, respectful towards, interested in and involved with indigenous Australian culture.\n\nI studied subjects relating to it at university. I understand, as much as I can being of British descent, what happened here and how the effects will be felt forever. But to be confronted with it first-hand in 2014 by people who an hour earlier were screaming together with these men in elation for Eddie Betts  was so hypocritical and disappointing.\n\nI posted this story as a Facebook  status on Monday afternoon, and not 24 hours later it had received more than 9000 likes — 36 hours later it has more than doubled. The response has been overwhelming, and I have received so many messages of congratulations and thanks, from across the state, country and the world.\n\nI am so glad the message has been received so positively by so many. However I am not looking for congratulations, as one woman has accused me of doing.\n\nI merely did what I was raised to do, and stood up for what was right. I did what everybody should be doing.\n\nI, like so many, hope to one day live in an Australia without division. We act like we have that, but the responses to my status have shown me that this still happens every day, often to the faces of the victims, and their children after them.\n\nThe education is there, the pathways are being paved, but so often we find that the minority is much louder. We see these stories of racism, often going unanswered. We hear about how it is ‘‘justified’’. We see responses to stories such as mine talking about how I must have run into the “good ones’’.\n\nI just hope that by standing up and defending my new friends, and then sharing my story with others who may wish they had had the courage to do the same in a similar situation once, I can show people how much good it can do to convince yourself that you’re brave, just for 20 seconds.\n\nThis is not an acceptable way to live. Someone wrote to me this week: “Reconciliation is just a word unless we live it’’. And that does go both ways. I am not saying racism is one-sided. But somebody needs to be willing to start trying.\n\nWhy not you?\n\nBrooke Skewes works in the hospitality industry and is a regular train commuter.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Skewes ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Opinion/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T01:17:49.000Z","description":"ON Sunday night following the Showdown in Adelaide, I finished work and headed to the train station.

Association of Former Intelligence Officers, says parts of the code match with Morse code letters found in the World War II Radio Operators Manual.\n\nCertain letters — or prosigns — were used to signify basic instructions to avoid using longer words.\n\nAnd while the message of the code itself is still unbroken, Mr Cramer believes to have found an even deeper mystery — micro-writing hidden within the letters of the five lines of code.\n\nHe said a line of micro-writing appears to refer to the de Havilland Venom — a British post-war jet, which was still on the drawing board at the time.\n\nThe Somerton Man is one of South Australia’s most enduring mysteries  and theories range from a man trying to visit his illegitimate son for the first time to a double agent murdered during the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nHe was found dead on Somerton Beach on December 1, 1948,  slumped against a seawall. He was never identified and an autopsy said he died of unnatural causes, probably because of an unknown poison.\n\nThe death coincided with the start of the Cold War  and, according to Mr Cramer, the visit to Adelaide of high-ranking British officials and weapons development at Woomera — the later site of nuclear testing.\n\nA coronial inquest found a roll of paper hidden in a secret pocket in the man’s clothing. \n\nOn it was printed Tamam Shud, or “finished” in Persian. It was torn from a book of Persian poetry — the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyáma . A Glenelg doctor found the book thrown through the open window of his car.\n\nWhen the back page of the book was treated with iodine during a coronial inquest, five lines of code appeared — letters that have mystified police, code-breakers and amateur sleuths the world and internet over.\n\nThe phone number of a local nurse, Jo Thomson, was found in the book. Her home was five minutes’ walk from where he was found dead. \n\nMs Thomson identified the body as one Alf Boxall, to whom she said she had given a copy of the Rubáiyát.\n\nBut Alf Boxall came forward, alive and with his copy of the Rubáiyát intact.\n\nMr Cramer, who lived in Adelaide from 1977 until 1990 and now lives on the Sunshine Coast, said a line of the micro-writing appears to refer to a British post-war jet.\n\nThe micro-writing is mainly inside the larger letters.\n\n“The larger letters then refer to what’s inside them,” he said.\n\n“I estimate there are 1100 characters incorporated in the letters.”\n\nOne of the clearest spots is the large ‘P’ — or ‘D’ in the middle of the third line. Darker lines can be seen in the black of the lower half of the swoop. \n\nAnd within the ‘B’ of the fourth line, again in the two swoops, “data markings” can be seen, he said.\n\n“There are four numbers in that loop,” he said. “And there is something in the O, in the bottom right as it curves up and in the A, across the middle, and in the Q.\n\n“What’s unusual is these smaller letters are shaped into the form of larger letters — I haven’t seen it before.”\n\nHe believes he’s solved some of the micro-writing’s significance — between and below the “SA” is “Venom X4621”. \n\n“This resembles the number of an early tender document number for the de Havilland Venom, which was still on the drawing board in 1948,” he said.\n\nThe Venom was a British post-war aircraft.\n\nAnd below the ‘AR’ is ‘LZ 5056’, which he thinks is a flight number of a Bulgarian Airlines flight from Sofia to London.\n\nMicro-writing in code can also be found elsewhere, Mr Cramer said, in Alf Boxall’s copy of the Rubáiyát, given to him — and inscribed by — Jo Thomson.\n\nThe inscription, which she signed as Jestyn, contains more examples of code micro-writing, he said.\n\nFor Mr Cramer, it conclusively links the three people together as the heart of the entire mystery.\n\nMr Cramer believes the Somerton Man intercepted much of the code, because of where the Morse code prosigns fall.\n\nHe points to specific letters in the code, which he says mean certain things.\n\nHe believes the Somerton Man was not the code’s intended target, and that he probably intercepted it.\n\n“In the top line, the ‘M’ signified the kind of message or the source. The ‘R’ normally means routine — there is no urgency,” he said.\n\n“The ‘AB’ at the end of the line means “all before”.\n\n“And ‘D’ is a prosign that means defer or deferred, which ties in with the R — this message is routine, it’s been deferred.”\n\nThe crossed-out second line appears to have been a mistake, although Mr Cramer says the line through it is actually four separate lines that look joined up.\n\nIn the third line, ‘T’ is a prosign that means transmit. The rest of the line is unbroken, while there is another ‘T’ at the end, followed by a dot and then a ‘P’ — or priority in the Morse code handbook. \n\nThe crossed lines in the centre were commonly used to signify two separate sessions of messages. Mr Cramer said the lines usually flowed back into each other at the other end.\n\nThe fourth line begins with “message” again, and is likely to be the corrected version of the second crossed-out second line, because of similarities in the LIA letters.\n\n“It looks like they copied down a whole lot more detail for the fourth line,” he said.\n\n“The ‘C’ at the end means ‘corrected version’.”\n\nThe fifth line begins with ‘V’ — or ‘from’.\n\n“It’s a guess, but I wonder if the previous lines were content from someone else, they have been possibly intercepted,” Mr Cramer said. “And the summary existed in that last line. Normally you get the call sign that follows the ‘V’, which could be the TTM — or tango tango mike.\n\n“T also means transmit, and the M could be referring to the standard Ms above.”\n\n“At the end is AB — but the B is actually an R. It doesn’t look the other Bs. And AR means ‘this is my last message — a response is not required or expected’.”\n\nThere are several other oddities within the code — the first and third Ms are very stylised, while the second and fourth Ms are quite normal.\n\nAnd the ‘S’ in the final lines is almost identical to the Aramaic ‘S’, which is a sign for water.\n\n“I don’t think it’s possible that’s what it means — that one must be a coincidence,” he said.\n\nMr Cramer is now working with an American professor to further examine the micro-writing, but not everyone agrees with him.\n\nProfessor Derek Abbott, who has studied the Somerton Man case for years,  remains unconvinced.\n\nThere isn’t enough resolution in the photo of the code to be sure, he said.\n\n“My scepticism regarding micro-writing stems from the fact that these are getting into the resolution limit of the image,” he said.\n\n“Further, the acid test for anything like this is that it should result in a message of significance. Until then, in my view, it remains unvalidated.”\n\nThe original piece of paper with the code has been lost.\n\nProfessor Abbott is urging the State Government  to exhume the Somerton Man, to solve one of the other big mysteries — whether or not he and Jo Thompson had a child together.\n\nIn January, the family of the nurse, who died in 2007, told 60 Minutes she may have been a spy and had a son with the Somerton Man. \n\nYou can sign Professor Abbott’s exhumation petition here  and read more about his extensive study into the case here. \n\nYou can read more at Gordon Cramer’s blog here. \n\n----\n\nEditor’s Note: The views and opinions expressed in the article are Gordon Cramer’s own and do not represent the views and opinions of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, or its directors.\n\n","byline":"Lynton Grace ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and photos/","/display/news.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photo/","/display/perthnow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/Best from Around/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Top News/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/south-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T02:11:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T02:11:34.000Z","description":"THE mysterious code in a poetry book linked to a still-unidentified man found dead on Somerton Beach in 1948 may have referred in part to a British post-war aircraft, according to a man who may have partially cracked the code.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv6-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv5-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv4-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv7-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv8-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fni6uo1m-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"7c10256b7a119d535b979414b3954411","keywords":["police sergeant","Police detectives","University Professor","funeral assistant","corrected version","West Terrace","drawing board","code letters","line means","code match","high-ranking British officials","micro writing stems","weapons development","phone number","Laurie Elliott","E.

Release of the information was fast-tracked after it emerged in State Parliament yesterday.\n\nThe Government is expected to release that report, by URS Australia, later this afternoon.\n\nThe Government has confirmed test results last year uncovered high levels of TCE, a metal cleaner, in air samples last year.\n\nAt high concentrations, the chemical is associated with liver and kidney cancers.\n\nOpposition Leader Steven Marshall this morning said Mr Hunter should resign.\n\n“He’s had plenty of opportunities over the last six weeks including 10 Parliamentary sitting days in that period where he could have informed the Parliament and informed the people of South Australia what was going on. He failed to do that and now he needs to resign,” Mr Marshall said.\n\n“This is just simply unacceptable that the Government have taken so long to take action.\n\nMr Hunter said the Government had to properly evaluate the report before taking action.\n\n“It’s important to understand that we’re talking about a chemical exposure which takes years, if not decades to have an impact, so the advice from Health was that it’s very unlikely that any residents have been exposed to levels of trichloroethylene which would have a negative impact on their health and that we should take our time to talk to them and give them this advice.\n\n“We had planned to do this today in fact but irresponsible questioning in Parliament yesterday, seeking to alarm people, forced the Government to move a little bit earlier so we brought it ahead by about 20 hours.”\n\nEARLIER\n\nRESIDENTS in 25 Clovelly Park homes have been told to move out after high levels of a potentially dangerous chemical were discovered in the air and soil.\n\nThe State Government last night sent teams of officials from the Environment Protection Authority and SA Health to doorknock homes in Ash Ave, Chestnut Crt and Mimosa Tce to advise latest testing had found increased levels of an industrial chemical.\n\nTrichloroethylene is believed to have entered the groundwater after use at the nearby Monroe factory.\n\nA report delivered to the Government in May found TCE was now present in soil and air samples from homes.\n\nSustainability, Environment and Conservation Minister Ian Hunter downplayed health risks for the mostly Housing Trust residents, who will be moved elsewhere in the coming months.\n\n“There are no immediate public health risks but there is a need to undertake some actions in the short term,” he said. “It’s not an emergency. This is long-term exposure we are worried about. A couple of weeks will make absolutely no difference, is our advice.”\n\nSA Health public health services director Kevin Buckett said the levels recorded in the affected homes were “thousands of times lower than the limits allowable in occupational settings” and “we wouldn’t expect anyone in the area to have had their health impacted”.\n\nThe affected residents, estimated at about 30, will be offered health checks.\n\nThe Government now faces political pressure over delays in alerting residents.\n\nMr Hunter on Wednesday confirmed the Government had been tracking the risk in Clovelly Park for years and been aware of elevated concentrations for several weeks.\n\nMr Hunter said the report obtained in May was audited by Government officials before he was told last week that “in an abundance of caution, we should consider options”.\n\n“I took that advice to Cabinet on Monday. Cabinet agreed to put in place a plan to talk to residents on Thursday to advise them of this latest information and to advise them that the Government would suggest they consider relocating,” Mr Hunter said.\n\nHowever, the Government was forced into immediate action late on Wednesday after the Opposition used Question Time to demand detailed answers from several ministers.\n\nPremier Jay Weatherill confirmed a “very extensive communication strategy” was being prepared but did not expand on details of the contamination discovered.\n\nLate on Wednesday, Mr Marshall said the Government had an obligation to inform people “as quickly as possible” if they were in danger. “That protocol has not been followed in this instance,” he said.\n\nIn 2010, nine residents were door-knocked and advised of testing being undertaken by Monroe, with a further 40 homes in the area letterbox dropped for information only. In 2008, residents were advised not to use bore water for any purpose after traces of TCE were found in groundwater off the Monroe and former Mitsubishi properties.\n\nAsh Ave resident Justin Pearce, 40, bought his Clovelly Park home about 15 years ago and said despite Mr Hunter personally knocking on his door last night, he felt he had been kept in the dark about testing in the area.\n\n“We had testing here last year, but it’s been six months without any information,” he said. He was last night told someone would be in contact within two weeks about moving. His biggest concern was for his two young sons.\n\n“They had ear infections and tonsillitis which (doctors) said weren’t related, but I wouldn’t be surprised.”\n\nAnother Ash Ave resident, Lisa, said she held concerns for the future health of her son, aged 10. \n\n“The long-term effects are concerning, my son was three when we moved in here. We won’t know until later what effect it’s had.”\n\nA Chestnut Ct resident of 18 years said eight people on her street had died from cancer in that time.\n\nMr Weatherill said the contamination levels were “of concern” for residents.\n\n“(But) There’s no evacuation,” Mr Weatherill said.\n\n“There’s going to be an orderly process of relocation so that the homes can be checked, made safe, hopefully people can go back into the homes they are in,” he said.\n\n“Rather than people running around frightening and alarming people we wanted to make sure they had the information in an orderly fashion and its sad that hasn’t happened.”\n\nMr Weatherill said that the Government would make sure there were no costs imposed on Housing Trust tenants to relocate but that it would consider what its responsibility was to the two private homes effected.\n\n“There are going to be steps taken to remediate (the Housing Trust properties) first we need to see whether that’s practical. If that is practical then people may be given the opportunity of being about to move back in into those home,” he said.\n\n— additional reporting Jordanna Schriever\n\nHOW IT UNFOLDED\n\nAugust 2012 — Monroe and site contamination consultant URS Australia begin indoor air and soil sampling assessments in Clovelly Park checking for TCE.\n\nFebruary 2013 — Testing finds TCE in indoor air at six properties.

of May for travelling in bicycle lanes for more than 50m.\n\nAmong those fined were motorcyclists and scooter riders who ducked and wove through cars and trucks banked up at traffic lights.\n\nThe data includes car and truck drivers but it is clear motorbike, scooter and even gopher riders breaking the law are at greatest risk of serious injury if collected by vehicles crossing their path.\n\nMotorists using dedicated bike lanes also pose a threat to cyclists.\n\nPolice could not break down how many motorbike, scooter or even gopher riders were included in those fined but The Advertiser photographers captured several offenders who risked a fine of $239 plus $60 Victims of Crime levy for travelling in bicycle lanes for more than 50m.\n\nA scooter rider told The Advertiser he regularly gambled by being in the bike lane or weaving through stationary traffic through frustration.\n\n“I do it a fair bit when traffic is backed up but I tend to go very slow and I’m really careful and I always look for the cars cutting over the lanes,’’ said the rider, who asked not to be named. “The biggest danger is with motorbikes that come up at speed.\n\n“But a lot scooter riders are just learning so they sit in the bike lane because it’s ... the safest place to be.’’\n\nHe said scooters with engines less than 50cc should be allowed to share the bike lanes with pushbikes.\n\nAnother scooter rider said he had stopped using bike lanes to overtake after being booked but he constantly saw others doing it.\n\n“I see a lot of people doing it but I don’t do it any more because it’s too dangerous,’’ he said.\n\nRiders weaving between lanes or overtaking on the left side of traffic are at high risk of collision if not seen by other motorists who turn left into streets or driveways, road safety experts say.\n\nPolice Traffic Support Branch Inspector Steve Kameniar said not only was it illegal for motorists to travel in bike lanes, it was also clearly dangerous.\n\n“The risk of not being seen by vehicles turning left or right across a bike lane is high,’’ he said.\n\n“The danger applies equally to bicycles and other vehicles when overtaking stationary or slow moving traffic on the left.’’\n\nMotor Accident Commission general manager for road safety Michael Cornish said motorcyclists should stick to the road rules.\n\nCycling fun as bikeway opens \n\n“Motorcycle riders are not allowed to use a bicycle lane unless they are entering or leaving a driveway or intersection,’’ he said.\n\n“Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users and by weaving in and out of traffic they increase the risk of not being seen.’’\n\nRAA traffic safety manager Charles Mountain said being in traffic jams was frustrating but it was “particularly dangerous’’ to weave through vehicles or overtake on the left.\n\n","byline":"DOUG ROBERTSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo

understood five asylum seeker families with at least two Australian-born children are being flown to the island this morning.\n\nAdvertiser.com.au believes four families are Burmese and one is Tamil.\n\nAt least 71 babies have been or will be sent to Christmas Island after their asylum seeker mothers were brought to the mainland to give birth.\n\nLast month eight families were woken before dawn to leave the Adelaide Hills detention centre and go to Christmas Island, where advocates say they face poor health facilities, cramped conditions including shared bathrooms, and fear they will be sent on to Nauru or Manus Island.\n\nA spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was a “normal transfer process” and that the youngest child was “approximately eight weeks of age”.\n\nThere were 14 people in four families being sent to Christmas Island, he said.\n\n“The Minister is advised the families have no further medical treatment required and have been deemed fit to return to Christmas Island,” he said.\n\n“Such transfers are subject to medical clearances.\n\n“The Minister is advised the detainees were notified in advance of the transfer and were not prevented from contacting family, friends or others prior to their departure from Inverbrackie.”\n\nThe latest development comes as pressures grows to strip Mr Morrison of his guardianship responsibilities for asylum seeker children as a dozen remain missing in Adelaide.\n\nClive Palmer, whose party holds the balance of power in the Senate, has joined the Greens move to replace Scott Morrison with an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors.\n\nHuman Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs is also in favour, declaring it a “conflict of interest”.\n\nTwo unaccompanied minors living in the northern suburbs were picked up by Immigration late last week and put into detention, which prompted 12 other asylum seekers to flee in fear of meeting the same fate.\n\nGreens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young will introduce a Bill as early as next week to establish an independent Guardian for Unaccompanied Children.\n\nShe said Mr Morrison should not be both “guardian and jailer”.\n\n“The Minister’s deafening silence on this issue (of the missing children) is of great concern as he is ultimately responsible for the safety and welfare of these children,” she said.\n\n“It is clear that the Minister’s obsession with secrecy is clouding his proper judgment to act in the best interest of these children.”\n\nMr Palmer agreed it was a “mistake” to have Mr Morrison fulfilling both duties and will discuss the matter with his three senators.\n\n“He has a joint role; he has to make decisions … I think it’s a good idea (to have an independent guardian),” he said.\n\n“Our policy is that they (asylum seekers) can fly in, have a hearing the same day at the airport and if they’re not genuine, fly them home.\n\n“I think it’s a bad thing (to keep children in detention) — that may affect them for the rest of their lives.”\n\nLabor’s position is not yet clear.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Morrison said he had “continued the practice of previous ministers in exercising these responsibilities”.\n\nProfessor Triggs said she had personally told Mr Morrison that it was a conflict of interest and that he should pass the responsibility on to someone else.\n\n“How can he possibly make a decision that holding them on Christmas Island, or to send them to Nauru is in their best interest?” she asked.\n\nAt a Human Rights Commission hearing into children in detention yesterday, Prof Triggs heard from a range of witnesses that it was detention itself that caused high levels of self harm and mental illness in asylum seeker children, not just the trauma they suffered in their homelands or on the perilous journey to Australia.\n\nThe Commission has collected drawings from some of the almost 1000 children in detention where they depict themselves behind bars, crying, and asking for help.\n\nMr Morrison’s spokesman said the department would work with the community detention service provider and SAPOL to “relocate missing detainees”.\n\n","byline":"TORY SHEPHERD POLITICAL EDITOR","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo

railroaded out of the All England Club by huge-serving Milos Raonic.\n\nTHE END: EXHAUSTED, SORE AND NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE \n\nBIG FAN: ROGER RATES KID KYRGIOS \n\nUK HOPE: MURRAY KNOCKED OUT OF WIMBLEDON \n\nLEGEND: FEDERER MOVES CLOSER TO RECORD \n\nREPLAY ALL THE ACTION FROM OUR LIVE BLOG BELOW\n\nThe eighth seed preyed on tiring Kyrgios to advance 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-4 7-6 (7-4) to a semi-final meeting with seven-time champion Roger Federer.\n\nFederer reached his 35th grand slam semi-final — and ninth at Wimbledon — with a 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-4 win over fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka as Raonic banished Krygios.\n\nExhausted and frustrated at not being able to secure a last-four appointment with his idol Federer, Kyrgios leaves Wimbledon knowing that he has the game to return and eventually win it.\n\nSupported by 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt, Ken Rosewall and Tony Roche, Kyrgios clearly struggled to recover from ousting Nadal.\n\nAs disappointed as he was to lose to Raonic, who cannoned down 39 aces, Krygios has plenty of reasons for positives.\n\n“Never did I think that I was ever going to make quarter-finals of Wimbledon and beat (Rafael) Nadal on centre court,” said Kyrgios after the match.\n\n“It’s all happened pretty fast.\n\n“I don’t think it’s completely sunk in yet, you know, the achievement. I’m just going to reflect on that the next couple days.”\n\nScheduled to contest Newport next week, the Canberran rises to a career-high mark of world No 66 and banks a prizemoney cheque of $432,000, almost doubling his career haul.\n\nBut Raonic, the first Canadian male to reach the semi-finals here, was a bridge too far.\n\nThe world No 9 was relieved and elated to have staved off Kyrgios.\n\n“It hasn’t really sunk in,” he said post-match.\n\n“To have that kind of win is pretty special.\n\n“It’s another step forward, the goal is to be the No 1 player in the world and this is another step towards that goal.”\n\nAttempting to become the first Wimbledon debutant to reach the semi-finals since David Nalbandian in 2002, Kyrgios lacked zip in the first set against Raonic.\n\nBut he showed plenty of class and resilience by winning, despite the Canadian having more — and better — opportunities.\n\nA framed forehand in the tiebreak rewarded Kyrgios’s doggedness but it became obvious he was running on fumes.\n\nBroken twice in the second set to allow Raonic to draw level, Kyrgios bounced back in the third set to claim an immediate break before leading 2-0.\n\nA few minutes later, he was back on the ropes as Raonic rolled through five successive games.\n\nKyrgios’s fatigue was illustrated in the botched smash he dumped into the net as Raonic maintained focus and intensity to keep the young Australian at bay.\n\n“I think it (the Nadal match) had a pretty big impact,” he said.\n\n“I was struggling physically about halfway through the second set. I was feeling sore in a couple places.\n\n“But I’m not going to take any credit away from him (Raonic) He served unbelievable.\n\n“I thought I came out strong on his first return game. I made him earn that.\n\n“All the other service games it looked like he was in such a rhythm that I just couldn’t do anything out there.”\n\nThe lanky right-hander methodically secured the third set, leaving Kyrgios with a huge task to reach the last four.\n\nKyrgios battled valiantly, regrouping to force a tiebreak.\n\nBut once there, he faltered leaving Raonic to cruise 6-1. There would be one final twist as Kyrgios saved three match points before Raonic hammered home a clinching ace.\n\nKyrgios bowed out to the acclaim of Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n“He’s a pretty exciting player to watch,” Dimitrov said. “Obviously he’s got a lot of skills and talent.”\n\nDjokovic was similarly generous.\n\n“Kyrgios just got into the mix in this tournament. He’s a 19-yearold, which is amazing.\n\n“It’s good for tennis to see that, because we lacked a little bit of successful teenagers in the last 10 years or so.\n\n“So we have these youngsters coming up, fearless on the court, hitting the ball, you know, not caring who is across the net.\n\n“It’s good. You know, it gets more attention to new faces and to new wave of generation that is able to challenge the best and be contending for grand slam titles.”\n\nKrygios stamped himself as a future champion with wins over Stephane Robert, Richard Gasquet, Jiri Vesely and Nadal.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

offer.\n\nWith the new device expected to be launched in two months, news.com.au has pulled together the best early indications of what to expect with the new model.\n\nAlthough Apple hasn’t confirmed any of these rumours, leaked images suggest these are the most likely features.\n\nHere’s what to expect from the iPhone 6.\n\n1. Super-size me\n\nThe most prevalent rumour about the new iPhone 6 is that Apple will, in fact, release two versions of the smartphone. There is set to be two different-sized models to be launched at the same time: a standard 4.7-inch model and an oversized 5.5-inch. The larger version is expected to be $100 more expensive but offer a better camera and a higher storage capacity.\n\n2. More brain power\n\nThe larger iPhone could have up to 128GB in storage capacity, according to Mac Rumours. Tech site 9to5Mac reports that the smaller version is expected to be released with 32GB and 64GB storage options.\n\n3. Size matters\n\nA larger body means a larger screen. As we reported early in the week, Australian market research firm Telsyte has found that Apple could lose almost half its potential iPhone 6 customer base if it simply pumped out another smartphone with roughly the same screen size. So it’s pleasing to hear the customers will have the choice of a 4.7-inch or a 5.5-inch display, which eclipses the iPhone 5S’s four inches. This will allow the iPhone 6 to better compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches), Sony Xperia Z2 (5.2 inches), LG G3 (5.5 inches) and Nokia Lumia 930 Windows 8 (5 inches). The screen could also go virtually to the edges of the phone for the first time.\n\niPhone 6 leak: metal case reveals same new #iPhone #design lines - http://t.co/3tL468vYfg pic.twitter.com/E6HKn3YLLs\n\n— HiddenRadio (@HiddenRadio) July 2, 2014 \n\n4. This baby’s got curves\n\nThe new model is likely to do away with the flat edges on the iPhone 4 and 5 and adopt a more curvaceous body. Expect a rounder design with curved edges.\n\n5. Slimline \n\nThe body of the phone is also expected to be much thinner than the iPhone 5S and more closely resemble the iPod touch. The slimline design is also expected to result in a lighter device.\n\n6. Glossy \n\nLeaked photographs show that the screen and body has a sleek, glossy finish. There are also rumours that the screen will be made of sapphire crystal, which will make it more resistant to scratches.\n\n7. What shall I call thee?\n\nThe new model is believed to be called the iPhone Air.\n\n8. Snap happy\n\nThe iPhone 6 is expected to have a better camera with more megapixels so it can better compete with its rivals. The phone is also likely to have superior image stabilisation, which helps users take clearer pictures while moving.\n\n9. I can see clearly now\n\nThe 4.7-inch screen is rumoured to have a clearer 1704-by-960 pixel resolution.\n\n10. Camera switcheroo\n\nThe front-facing camera appears to be back on the left-side of the ear speaker, similar to where it was for the iPhone 4. (It was above the earpiece for the iPhone 5.)\n\nThe latest rumours suggest the iPhone 6 will be launched on September 9.\n\n","byline":"JAMES LAW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/Smartphones/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/Gadgets/Mobile Phones/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/","/display/news.com.au/Technology/Gadgets/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/Smartphones/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/TechKnow/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/Smartphones/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Technology - syndicated/Gadgets/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/couriermail.com.au/technology/","/section/couriermail.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/news.com.au/technology/","/section/news.com.au/technology/gadgets/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/technology/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/perthnow.com.au/technology/","/section/perthnow.com.au/technology/smartphones/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/technology/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/technology/smartphones/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T00:43:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T00:43:27.000Z","description":"A BIGGER screen.

The room was used to recover radioactive americium, a byproduct of plutonium.\n\nCovered with blood, McCluskey was dragged from the room and put into an ambulance and driven to the decontamination centre. Because he was too hot to handle, McCluskey was removed by remote control and transported to a steel-and-concrete isolation tank.\n\nDuring the next five months, doctors laboriously extracted tiny bits of glass and razor-sharp pieces of metal embedded in his skin.\n\nNurses scrubbed him down three times a day and shaved every inch of his body every day. The radioactive bathwater and thousands of towels became nuclear waste.\n\nMcCluskey also received some 600 shots of zinc DTPA, an experimental drug that helped him excrete the radioactive material.\n\nHe was placed in isolation in a decontamination facility for five months. Within a year, his body’s radiation count had fallen by about 80 per cent and he was allowed to return home.\n\nBut his radiation-related medical problems proliferated. He had a kidney infection, four heart attacks in as many months and cataract surgery on both eyes, followed by a cornea transplant and a precipitous drop in his blood platelet count, which required transfusions.\n\nFriends at first avoided him until his minister told people it was safe to be around him. The accident sapped his stamina, and he was unable to hunt, fish or do any of the things he had planned for his retirement.\n\nHe was studied extensively by doctors for the rest of his life and died of coronary artery disease in 1987 at the age of 75.\n\nHanford contains the nation’s greatest collection of nuclear waste, and for more than two decades has been engaged in the dangerous work of cleaning up that waste.\n\nThe space now dubbed the McCluskey Room is located inside the closed Plutonium Finishing Plant and is scheduled for clean-up.\n\n“It’s been largely closed up since the accident,” Geoff Tyree, a spokesman for the US Department of Energy in Richland, said Wednesday. “It was restricted for the potential for airborne radiation contamination.”\n\nSince 2008, the Department of Energy and contractor CH2M HILL Plateau Remediation Company have been preparing the plant for demolition.\n\n“About two-thirds of the Plutonium Finishing Plant is deactivated — cleaned out and ready for demolition,” said Jon Peschong, an assistant DOE manager in Richland. “Cleaning out the McCluskey Room will be a major step forward.”\n\nWhen specially trained and equipped workers enter the room, they will encounter airborne radioactivity, surface contamination, confined spaces and poor ventilation, the DOE said.\n\nThey will be wearing abrasion-resistant suits that protect them from surface contamination and chemicals. A dual-purpose air system will provide cool air for breathing and cool air throughout the suit for worker comfort, allowing them to work for longer periods of time. The suits are pressurized, to prevent workers from coming into contact with airborne contaminants.\n\nThe McCluskey Room “is going to be the toughest work ahead of us as we finish cleaning the plant and getting it ready for demolition by the end of September 2016,” Tyree said.\n\n","byline":"AP and Ian Horswill

language and facial features of an Asian woman on a Sydney to Newcastle train on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe incident was filmed by a passenger and posted on YouTube. The woman became angry at two young children when they didn’t give their seats up for her.\n\nShe then began to abuse other passengers, including a man who was sitting next to an Asian woman. “Who is this little jerk-off? He can only get a gook - he can’t even get a regular girlfriend. It is so sad,” she said, as passengers groaned in offence.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan, he has got a gook.”\n\nAfter she caused a scene inside the carriage, police spoke to the woman when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney’s west.\n\n“There were police patrolling from a local area command,” police transport command assistant commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters.\n\n“They were there for another matter, unaware of the full circumstances of this situation.\n\nPolice spoke to the woman but decided to let her “go about her journey”, Mr Mitchell said.\n\nMr Mitchell didn’t know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed the woman would be charged for her “abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour”.\n\n“The person responsible will be prosecuted,” he said.\n\nIf found guilty of offensive behaviour, she faces a $500 fine.\n\n“This person has committed offensive behaviour,” Mr Mitchell said.\n\n“It is a crime that we will not tolerate, particularly in regards to the racial motivation behind this incident.”\n\nThe woman told ninemsn she had a rotten day and had been scammed out of $100,000 from a man she had met on a dating website.\n\nSydney Trains chief Howard Collins said he was “shocked” by the rant and the company would be working with police to investigate.\n\n“I’m just amazed - we’ve got to stamp this out,” he said.\n\nIn April, Rebecca Blessington, 28, was charged after allegedly racially abusing two Asian women on a train from Town Hall to Bondi\n\nJade Marr boarded the train at Central Station when Ms Wilkins told her two children and two nephews, aged between four and 10, to get off the seats.\n\n“I was in shock at the time. I’m probably more angry today that someone could be that low and attack a child or anyone else.\n\n“Everyone took it seriously but it actually became quite comical, it was just ridiculous.”\n\n“We were just thinking ‘what are you doing’? It was unbelievable.\n\n“She called the police and her goal was to get my children removed from the train because they were sitting on a seat.\n\n“We don’t catch the train very often so the kids were worried they had done the wrong thing. \n\nPOLICE CHARGE WOMAN OVER RACISTS RANT \n\nRACIST RANT ON SYDNEY BUS CAUGHT ON CAMERA \n\nTAMARAMA SURF VICTIM WAS FATHER OF TWO \n\nTHREE CHARGED OVER CROWN WITNESS KILLING \n\n“They were frightened that the police were coming to get them. I just kept telling them that they hadn’t done anything wrong and that this woman was not responding the way that normal people do.\n\n“My nephew was really concerned about the words she was using and the way she spoke to the other woman.\n\n“The kids just didn’t understand why someone would say that.”\n\nMs Wilkins was in apologetic mood this afternoon.\n\n“I had a rotten day,’ she told Ninemsn . ‘I’ve been chasing work for quite some time now,” she said.\n\n“It’s awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,” Ms Wilkins said.\n\nWilkins became enraged at some young children after they did not give into her demands for a seat on a morning Central Coast train.\n\nShe then started abusing passengers including an Asian woman and a man who stood up for her.\n\n“Who is this little jerk off he can only get a gook, he can’t even get a regular girlfriend — it is so sad,” she said.\n\n“Is it really that small that you can’t get an Aussie girl? Poor man. Look at this bogan he has got a gook — look at it. She probably thinks he is rich.”\n\nThe video was posted onto YouTube by user Kareem Abdul.\n\n“On the Central coast & Newcastle line in peak hour during school holidays,” Abdul wrote.\n\n“I started filming as the woman became aggressive toward some children (ages 12 and under) who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded.\n\n“This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids.\n\n“The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her and now the lady is calling the police … Because the kids didn’t move?”\n\n","byline":"Ben Pike and Ian Walker

leave over the mid-season AFL break have been told they will be required to work a major event on Friday, July 25, at Adelaide Oval.\n\nA July clash is the perfect off-season preparation for European clubs and the Reds, who host Melbourne Victory on October 17 at Adelaide Oval.\n\nNeither AFL clubs Adelaide or Port Adelaide play at Adelaide Oval in the last weekend of July.\n\nAdelaide United’s former Barcelona youth coach Josep Gombau enjoys a bulging contact book from Argentine great Lionel Messi to the greats of Spain’s golden generation.\n\nHowever, it is Gombau’s links with La Liga officials that stand to deliver a slice of overdue football heaven.\n\nSouth Australia was outflanked by eastern states and Canberra who will host Tim Cahill’s Socceroos in Asian Cup fixtures through January 2015.\n\nThe Spanish government is using glamour La Liga clubs to spread its “culture and brand”.\n\nThis month’s exhibition game could lead to Adelaide’s possible inclusion in a Spanish-run LFP World Club summer tournament.\n\nMalaga could also play against Perth Glory this month.\n\nLuring one of the Spanish big three, Real Madrid, Barcelona or Atletico Madrid would be an outlandish coup.\n\nHowever, high calibre outfits such Javi Gracia’s Malaga would pack a venue that has been restricted to cricket and AFL fixtures since the completion of a $535 million, tax-payer funded upgrade.\n\nMalaga — supported by many English expats along the “coast of the sun” — boast the likes of former Bayern Munich and Manchester City striker Roque Santa Cruz, and Liverpool loan forward Luis Alberto on the books.\n\nGombau has spent the off-season in Catalonia where he met with La Liga officials and searched for players and expertise to bolster the Reds.\n\nLanding La Liga opposition for the Reds in a one-off or ongoing arrangement would provide a massive boost at Hindmarsh and game in general.\n\nGombau is preparing for a busy pre-season, appointed to steer the A-League All-Stars against Italian powerhouse Juventus at ANZ Stadium on 10 August.\n\nA La Liga side taking on the Reds adds lustre to an A-League that is set to welcome Spanish super star David Villa and England stalwart Frank Lampard at Melbourne City this season.\n\n","byline":"RICHARD EARLE ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

In fact she reportedly threw a punch at the Groundhog Day star.\n\nWhen asked about the onset spat, Murray told the New York Times, “Look, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me.\n\n“When our relationship is professional, and you’re not getting that done, forget it.”\n\nIn the years since, Murray appears to have moved on, saying, “I feel very warmly for her (Liu) now”.\n\nKenny Baker (R2D2) v Anthony Daniels (C3PO): Star Wars (1977)\n\nRobots aren’t meant to have feelings, but Kenny Baker certainly did after working with Anthony Daniels on Star Wars.\n\n“Anthony doesn’t mix at all — he keeps himself to himself,” Baker said.\n\n“He never wants to have a drink with any of us. Once when I said hello to him he just turned his back on me and said, ‘Can’t you see I’m having a conversation?’ I was blazing with rage.\n\n“It was the rudest thing anyone had ever done to me. I was furious. It was unbelievable.”\n\nBea Arthur v Betty White: Golden Girls (1985-1992)\n\nOn the small screen Dorothy and Rose were the best of friends, but in real life Bea Arthur couldn’t stand Betty White.\n\n“She (Arthur) was not that fond of me,” Betty White said in 2011. “She found me a pain in the neck sometimes. It was my positive attitude — and that made Bea mad sometimes. If I was happy, she’d be furious!”\n\nAccording to Rue McClanahan (who played Blanche), the feud lasted long after the show wrapped up. Apparently in 2002, McClanahan’s husband spoke to Bea Arthur and thanked her for inviting him to her Broadway show. “I love Rue.” Arthur reportedly said, before adding, “Betty [White] is a cu**.”\n\nNick Nolte v Julia Roberts: I Love Trouble (1994)\n\nIn the film they played two competing reporters who worked together to solve a crime. But behind the scenes, Nolte and Roberts wanted nothing to do with each other.\n\nWhen the movie was done, Roberts labelled Nolte “a disgusting human being”.\n\nIn response, Nolte said, “She’s (Julia Roberts) not a nice person”.\n\n“Everyone knows that. But it’s not important to me whether I’m liked or disliked. Some people like me. Some don’t. Some people I like working with, some I don’t.”\n\nLL Cool J v Jamie Foxx: Any Given Sunday (1999)\n\nIn the football movie, Foxx and LL Cool J (real name James Todd Smith) were teammates but behind the scenes they were more like enemies. The pair came to blows onset after Cool J hit Foxx in the head during a scene, even though it wasn’t in the script. Foxx fought back and before you know it there was an all out brawl.\n\nThe police were called and Foxx filed a complaint, but no charges were laid.\n\nYou can check out the police report here.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker v Kim Cattrall: Sex and the City (1998-2004)\n\nApparently Kim Cattrall was angry that Sarah Jessica Parker got paid more than the other cast members, whereas Parker was allegedly jealous that Cattrall’s character (Samantha) was so popular with the show’s fans.\n\nThe two have always denied the feud (not surprisingly) but after the filming of Sex and the City 2, Parker did tell Marie Claire, “There are times when all of us have been sensitive and sometimes feelings get hurt.\n\n“But I don’t have any regrets about how I’ve treated people.”\n\n","byline":"ANDREW BUCKLOW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment -

","width":100},"title":"Famous co-stars who hated each other"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"The photo — which shows the first time Bethany Townsend, 23, dared to bare after being fitted with two colostomy bags — has now been viewed by an incredible nine million people.\n\nBethany, a makeup artist from Worcester in the UK, has been so overwhelmed by the response that she can finally acknowledge that the colostomy bags doesn’t define who she is.\n\n“I didn’t expect this kind of reaction at all,” she said of the picture.\n\n“When I first had the bags fitted I was devastated — the reaction to this photo has really helped me accept them.\n\n“The photo has been seen by millions of people ... I’m just so glad that it’s brought about more awareness of Crohn’s disease, and it’s made me feel so much more confident.”\n\nBethany was fitted with her colostomy bags after battling with Crohn’s disease since the age of three. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, affecting the sufferer’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste.\n\nIn extreme situations like Bethany’s, it becomes necessary to remove the damaged section of the intestine and bring the healthy part out as a stoma — known as a colostomy.\n\nAfter almost dying when her bowel ruptured in 2010, Bethany woke from a life-saving operation to find she had been fitted with two colostomy bags.\n\n“Growing up I’d had various surgeries to try and combat the Crohn’s,” said Townsend. “I’d go in and have sections of my intestine cut out, but I’d only be in remission for a couple of weeks before it came back again.\n\n“Then, four years ago I woke up in the morning and couldn’t move because I was in so much agony. I had to break a glass on the floor to alert my mum who called on ambulance. When the paramedics came they lifted up my top to see that my surgery scar had split open. I was rushed to intensive care where they doctors told me family I would need more surgery as my intestines had become infected and inflamed again. I had no idea when I woke up that I would have the bags.\n\n“When I first woke up and my mum told me about them I was just relieved as I’d thought I was going to die. When I came out of hospital and everything finally sunk in, I remember going upstairs into my bedroom and just bursting into tears.\n\n“I’d known a colostomy bag might have been an option but it was always something that I had wanted to avoid. I had a really good cry that day, and since then I haven’t shed another tear — I’ve just got on with it I suppose.”\n\nIt was only after Townsend met and married her husband, Ian, 33, and jetted off to Mexico last Christmas that she finally felt ready to embrace the colostomy bags.\n\n“When I met Ian I showed him my bags straight away, but he didn’t bat an eye lid — I actually felt like I was overreacting,” she said.\n\n“He taught me that there was more to me than the bags and would always encourage me to show off my figure. I wasn’t sure but in Mexico I finally realised he was right, and decided to wear my bikini.\n\n“At first I was nervous and worried that people would stare but it was fine. The staff at the hotel asked me about the bags on the last day of the holiday, but rather than being offended I was glad because it meant I could talk to them about Crohn’s and tell them what it is.\n\n“I decided to get in touch with Crohn’s and Colitis UK Facebook group to see if they would let me post something on their page. I sent them the picture and my information, and it all blew up from there.”\n\nTownsend still suffers from Crohn’s disease and hopes ones day for a cure, but for now she is considering getting back into modelling — a career she gave up on after she was fitted with the bags.\n\n“I feel confident enough now to put myself out there and pursue modelling again,” she said.\n\n“I did a little bit of work here and there before I had the colostomy bags, but once I had them fitted I thought that was the end of the dream. I’m looking forward to chasing my goals, and I know now that nothing can hold me back.\n\n“I won’t let the Crohn’s control me anymore.”\n\n","byline":"Caters News ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle -

He’s undersized, there’s no doubt about that, but he makes up for it with his competitiveness.”\n\nThe last time Port played without Carlile and Trengove in an AFL game was round 12, 2009. While the Power had a taste of playing without them in the preseason, their absence comes at an awkward time given the size of Bomber forwards Joe Daniher and Jake Carlisle.\n\n“Carlisle is in good marking form and Daniher is going to be a superstar,” Nicks said.\n\nBut Port will also look to turn the match-ups in to a positive, using any advantage they have in speed and mobility to run off the Essendon forwards.\n\n“When you play against a really tall forward line it’s a scary thought if the ball keeps coming in the air over and over,” Nicks said.\n\n“But from a positive point of view, if you can get the ball on the ground you’ve got the ability to move it out quicker.”\n\nPort defender Jasper Pittard said Carlile and Trengove would be missed but echoed Ken Hinkley’s message that the Power don’t rely on individuals.\n\n“They’ve been rock solid for us all year,” Pittard said.\n\n“But we’re not a personnel-based team — that’s the mantra Kenny drives.\n\n“I’m not sure who the coaches will go for but Cam O’Shea and Tom Clurey are more than capable of playing the key position roles.”\n\n","byline":"Jai Bednall

Adelaide Oval — regaining control of its September dream in the process.\n\nThe false dawns will be behind ninth-placed Adelaide with successive victories against the Giants at Spotless Stadium.\n\n“Our heads are still above water, still in the race and only one game out of the eight so our destiny is in our own hands,” 259-game veteran Thompson told The Advertiser.\n\n“It was the biggest win of the season so we have shown enough when we do get it together.\n\n“Hopefully we can take a lot of confidence and self belief within the group that we are good enough and get the ball rolling.”\n\nPort won contested possessions 154-128 in its March Showdown victory but Adelaide turned the tables with a 163-133 advantage on Sunday.\n\nThompson sees the green shoots of a Crows recovery as they target back-to-back wins for the first time since round six after a run of success against St Kilda, GWS and Western Bulldogs.\n\n“We are getting better but are still patchy and that is what we need to get rid of. Our best footy is good enough. Against Port we played four quarters,” said Thompson, who kicked his 150th goal against the Power.\n\n“It was a gutsy win. There is no doubt we were heavy underdogs, they sat top for a reason.\n\n“When you have weight of numbers you will win more often than not.”\n\nThompson is in white hot form – gathering 34 touches, seven tackles and a goal against Port – only shaded by ruckman Sam Jacobs in Showdown medal voting.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield’s 22 contested possessions and Rory Sloane’s nine influential tackles dismantled Port in a hand-to-hand midfield combat.\n\n“They have a quality midfield and lot of guys who can roll through there but I thought our midfield was outstanding the way we pressured the ball, hunted the footy and balance around the contest was quite good,” said Thompson.\n\n“It is always good when the big boy hits the scoreboard. Not only is he a very good ruckman off the hand but reads the play well for a big guy,” said Thompson of Jacobs, who also earnt 10 AFL coaches association votes.\n\n“I am enjoying my footy, we have a great young group together.”\n\nBrad Crouch and Matthew Wright also excelled against Port with Thompson sensing a solidification of the playing group ahead of the Giants clash.\n\nThompson predicted four-goal hero Eddie Betts’s second half of the season “will be even better” than the first and implored fans to keep the faith after what has been a bumpy ride.\n\n“We do owe the supporters a big thank you and hope they do stick with us. We are trying to get off that rollercoaster and can hopefully string a few wins together,” said Thompson.\n\n","byline":"RICHARD EARLE

lining up for around 10 minutes I managed to squeeze into the last carriage, where I looked for an empty seat as I didn’t plan on standing for the entire trip to the end of the line. All the seats were taken, except one.\n\nThree Aboriginal men were sitting in a four-berth seat by the door, where most people were crowded around. I hesitated for a second, to make sure nobody else was heading for the seat, and then walked through the standing passengers and asked if the seat was being used.\n\nThe men, having been sitting quietly, suddenly perked up and the man sitting next to the empty seat smiled and said, “No, you can sit here, please”. So I did.\n\nTo begin with, the men were quiet and respectful and didn’t talk or look at me. I could sense some discomfort so I made a comment about how cold it was. This was met with more smiles and nods of agreement.\n\nVIDEO: Vile racist rant on Sydney train \n\nA minute or so later one of the men broke the ice by asking me what the time was, and when I thought the train would be leaving. Soon we were talking about all sorts of things.\n\nWe discussed the footy (they were supporting the wrong team), arguing about the cricket (you can’t go for the West Indies having just left Adelaide Oval), and laughing about netball — the oldest man’s wife loves it and we all agreed it is terrible.\n\nWe also discovered how many of the same places we had visited. They come from Alice Springs and I have travelled as far north as Pukatja and the surrounding towns. We discussed donkeys and camels and what I had been doing there — in 2005 I had travelled up with a rock band to take live music to the APY communities.\n\nAs the men reached their destination, they stood up and called out goodbyes and waved to the other passengers. The oldest man said ‘‘God bless you mob’’ before exiting the carriage. As the doors closed I waved one last time to the last guy saying, ‘‘See ya sis’’, and from behind me I heard the words, ‘‘Thank God”.\n\nI thought for a second, decided to ignore the comment, and started to put in my headphones. Then I was tapped on the shoulder, and a comment was made along the lines of ‘‘Bet you’re relieved — those people really shouldn’t be allowed to drink!’’, followed by nervous giggling.\n\nI turned to see a group of women sitting in the seats behind me, looking concerned and sympathetic. I removed the earphone, took a deep breath, and launched quietly into speech along the following lines:\n\n“Excuse me! Those men were the friendliest, most polite people I have sat with on a train in years. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting with them and it completely sucks that when they got off, I was left sitting on a train amid a bunch of rude women, surrounded by an entire train full of white people who I am sure represent the very destruction of the traditional home of those men.\n\n“Yet if anyone on the train had made the effort to speak to or even look at one of these blokes, they would have been treated with respect and friendliness.\n\n“As for the alcohol you believed you could smell on them, yes, they have been at the football and had a couple of drinks, as did you obviously, but the alcohol you can smell is from me. I served hundreds of people today and am covered in beer and wine.\n\n“Don’t you dare even think about responding to me right now, you disgust me and should be ashamed of yourselves”.\n\nA small section of the carriage near us applauded quietly. One of the women cried, and the majority pretended they weren’t even on the train and had heard nothing. Maybe they didn’t. But they will now.\n\n■ ■ ■ ■\n\nMy mother grew up along the South Australian section of The Ghan train line. My family has travelled extensively through the Outback on holidays as children and teenagers, and I was brought up to be aware of, respectful towards, interested in and involved with indigenous Australian culture.\n\nI studied subjects relating to it at university. I understand, as much as I can being of British descent, what happened here and how the effects will be felt forever. But to be confronted with it first-hand in 2014 by people who an hour earlier were screaming together with these men in elation for Eddie Betts  was so hypocritical and disappointing.\n\nI posted this story as a Facebook  status on Monday afternoon, and not 24 hours later it had received more than 9000 likes — 36 hours later it has more than doubled. The response has been overwhelming, and I have received so many messages of congratulations and thanks, from across the state, country and the world.\n\nI am so glad the message has been received so positively by so many. However I am not looking for congratulations, as one woman has accused me of doing.\n\nI merely did what I was raised to do, and stood up for what was right. I did what everybody should be doing.\n\nI, like so many, hope to one day live in an Australia without division. We act like we have that, but the responses to my status have shown me that this still happens every day, often to the faces of the victims, and their children after them.\n\nThe education is there, the pathways are being paved, but so often we find that the minority is much louder. We see these stories of racism, often going unanswered. We hear about how it is ‘‘justified’’. We see responses to stories such as mine talking about how I must have run into the “good ones’’.\n\nI just hope that by standing up and defending my new friends, and then sharing my story with others who may wish they had had the courage to do the same in a similar situation once, I can show people how much good it can do to convince yourself that you’re brave, just for 20 seconds.\n\nThis is not an acceptable way to live. Someone wrote to me this week: “Reconciliation is just a word unless we live it’’. And that does go both ways. I am not saying racism is one-sided. But somebody needs to be willing to start trying.\n\nWhy not you?\n\nBrooke Skewes works in the hospitality industry and is a regular train commuter.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Skewes ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Opinion/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T01:17:49.000Z","description":"ON Sunday night following the Showdown in Adelaide, I finished work and headed to the train station.

He was never identified and an autopsy said he died of unnatural causes, probably because of an unknown poison.\n\nThe death coincided with the start of the Cold War  and, according to Mr Cramer, the visit to Adelaide of high-ranking British officials and weapons development at Woomera — the later site of nuclear testing.\n\nA coronial inquest found a roll of paper hidden in a secret pocket in the man’s clothing. \n\nOn it was printed Tamam Shud, or “finished” in Persian. It was torn from a book of Persian poetry — the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyáma . A Glenelg doctor found the book thrown through the open window of his car.\n\nWhen the back page of the book was treated with iodine during a coronial inquest, five lines of code appeared — letters that have mystified police, code-breakers and amateur sleuths the world and internet over.\n\nThe phone number of a local nurse, Jo Thomson, was found in the book. Her home was five minutes’ walk from where he was found dead. \n\nMs Thomson identified the body as one Alf Boxall, to whom she said she had given a copy of the Rubáiyát.\n\nBut Alf Boxall came forward, alive and with his copy of the Rubáiyát intact.\n\nMr Cramer, who lived in Adelaide from 1977 until 1990 and now lives on the Sunshine Coast, said a line of the micro-writing appears to refer to a British post-war jet.\n\nThe micro-writing is mainly inside the larger letters.\n\n“The larger letters then refer to what’s inside them,” he said.\n\n“I estimate there are 1100 characters incorporated in the letters.”\n\nOne of the clearest spots is the large ‘P’ — or ‘D’ in the middle of the third line. Darker lines can be seen in the black of the lower half of the swoop. \n\nAnd within the ‘B’ of the fourth line, again in the two swoops, “data markings” can be seen, he said.\n\n“There are four numbers in that loop,” he said. “And there is something in the O, in the bottom right as it curves up and in the A, across the middle, and in the Q.\n\n“What’s unusual is these smaller letters are shaped into the form of larger letters — I haven’t seen it before.”\n\nHe believes he’s solved some of the micro-writing’s significance — between and below the “SA” is “Venom X4621”. \n\n“This resembles the number of an early tender document number for the de Havilland Venom, which was still on the drawing board in 1948,” he said.\n\nThe Venom was a British post-war aircraft.\n\nAnd below the ‘AR’ is ‘LZ 5056’, which he thinks is a flight number of a Bulgarian Airlines flight from Sofia to London.\n\nMicro-writing in code can also be found elsewhere, Mr Cramer said, in Alf Boxall’s copy of the Rubáiyát, given to him — and inscribed by — Jo Thomson.\n\nThe inscription, which she signed as Jestyn, contains more examples of code micro-writing, he said.\n\nFor Mr Cramer, it conclusively links the three people together as the heart of the entire mystery.\n\nMr Cramer believes the Somerton Man intercepted much of the code, because of where the Morse code prosigns fall.\n\nHe points to specific letters in the code, which he says mean certain things.\n\nHe believes the Somerton Man was not the code’s intended target, and that he probably intercepted it.\n\n“In the top line, the ‘M’ signified the kind of message or the source. The ‘R’ normally means routine — there is no urgency,” he said.\n\n“The ‘AB’ at the end of the line means “all before”.\n\n“And ‘D’ is a prosign that means defer or deferred, which ties in with the R — this message is routine, it’s been deferred.”\n\nThe crossed-out second line appears to have been a mistake, although Mr Cramer says the line through it is actually four separate lines that look joined up.\n\nIn the third line, ‘T’ is a prosign that means transmit. The rest of the line is unbroken, while there is another ‘T’ at the end, followed by a dot and then a ‘P’ — or priority in the Morse code handbook. \n\nThe crossed lines in the centre were commonly used to signify two separate sessions of messages. Mr Cramer said the lines usually flowed back into each other at the other end.\n\nThe fourth line begins with “message” again, and is likely to be the corrected version of the second crossed-out second line, because of similarities in the LIA letters.\n\n“It looks like they copied down a whole lot more detail for the fourth line,” he said.\n\n“The ‘C’ at the end means ‘corrected version’.”\n\nThe fifth line begins with ‘V’ — or ‘from’.\n\n“It’s a guess, but I wonder if the previous lines were content from someone else, they have been possibly intercepted,” Mr Cramer said. “And the summary existed in that last line. Normally you get the call sign that follows the ‘V’, which could be the TTM — or tango tango mike.\n\n“T also means transmit, and the M could be referring to the standard Ms above.”\n\n“At the end is AB — but the B is actually an R. It doesn’t look the other Bs. And AR means ‘this is my last message — a response is not required or expected’.”\n\nThere are several other oddities within the code — the first and third Ms are very stylised, while the second and fourth Ms are quite normal.\n\nAnd the ‘S’ in the final lines is almost identical to the Aramaic ‘S’, which is a sign for water.\n\n“I don’t think it’s possible that’s what it means — that one must be a coincidence,” he said.\n\nMr Cramer is now working with an American professor to further examine the micro-writing, but not everyone agrees with him.\n\nProfessor Derek Abbott, who has studied the Somerton Man case for years,  remains unconvinced.\n\nThere isn’t enough resolution in the photo of the code to be sure, he said.\n\n“My scepticism regarding micro-writing stems from the fact that these are getting into the resolution limit of the image,” he said.\n\n“Further, the acid test for anything like this is that it should result in a message of significance. Until then, in my view, it remains unvalidated.”\n\nThe original piece of paper with the code has been lost.\n\nProfessor Abbott is urging the State Government  to exhume the Somerton Man, to solve one of the other big mysteries — whether or not he and Jo Thompson had a child together.\n\nIn January, the family of the nurse, who died in 2007, told 60 Minutes she may have been a spy and had a son with the Somerton Man. \n\nYou can sign Professor Abbott’s exhumation petition here  and read more about his extensive study into the case here. \n\nYou can read more at Gordon Cramer’s blog here. \n\n----\n\nEditor’s Note: The views and opinions expressed in the article are Gordon Cramer’s own and do not represent the views and opinions of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, or its directors.\n\n","byline":"Lynton Grace ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and photos/","/display/news.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photo/","/display/perthnow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/Best from Around/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Top News/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/south-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-03T02:11:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-03T02:11:34.000Z","description":"THE mysterious code in a poetry book linked to a still-unidentified man found dead on Somerton Beach in 1948 may have referred in part to a British post-war aircraft, according to a man who may have partially cracked the code.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv6-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv5-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv4-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv7-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fnii5yv8-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/has-part-of-the-mysterious-somerton-man-code-been-cracked/story-fni6uo1m-1226975308014?sv=a12a4675d179cec13f17c2e1c7c5d20d","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"7c10256b7a119d535b979414b3954411","keywords":["police sergeant","Police detectives","University Professor","funeral assistant","corrected version","West Terrace","drawing board","code letters","line means","code match","high-ranking British officials","micro writing stems","weapons development","phone number","Laurie Elliott","E.

Release of the information was fast-tracked after it emerged in State Parliament yesterday.\n\nThe Government is expected to release that report, by URS Australia, later this afternoon.\n\nThe Government has confirmed test results last year uncovered high levels of TCE, a metal cleaner, in air samples last year.\n\nAt high concentrations, the chemical is associated with liver and kidney cancers.\n\nOpposition Leader Steven Marshall this morning said Mr Hunter should resign.\n\n“He’s had plenty of opportunities over the last six weeks including 10 Parliamentary sitting days in that period where he could have informed the Parliament and informed the people of South Australia what was going on. He failed to do that and now he needs to resign,” Mr Marshall said.\n\n“This is just simply unacceptable that the Government have taken so long to take action.\n\nMr Hunter said the Government had to properly evaluate the report before taking action.\n\n“It’s important to understand that we’re talking about a chemical exposure which takes years, if not decades to have an impact, so the advice from Health was that it’s very unlikely that any residents have been exposed to levels of trichloroethylene which would have a negative impact on their health and that we should take our time to talk to them and give them this advice.\n\n“We had planned to do this today in fact but irresponsible questioning in Parliament yesterday, seeking to alarm people, forced the Government to move a little bit earlier so we brought it ahead by about 20 hours.”\n\nEARLIER\n\nRESIDENTS in 25 Clovelly Park homes have been told to move out after high levels of a potentially dangerous chemical were discovered in the air and soil.\n\nThe State Government last night sent teams of officials from the Environment Protection Authority and SA Health to doorknock homes in Ash Ave, Chestnut Crt and Mimosa Tce to advise latest testing had found increased levels of an industrial chemical.\n\nTrichloroethylene is believed to have entered the groundwater after use at the nearby Monroe factory.\n\nA report delivered to the Government in May found TCE was now present in soil and air samples from homes.\n\nSustainability, Environment and Conservation Minister Ian Hunter downplayed health risks for the mostly Housing Trust residents, who will be moved elsewhere in the coming months.\n\n“There are no immediate public health risks but there is a need to undertake some actions in the short term,” he said. “It’s not an emergency. This is long-term exposure we are worried about. A couple of weeks will make absolutely no difference, is our advice.”\n\nSA Health public health services director Kevin Buckett said the levels recorded in the affected homes were “thousands of times lower than the limits allowable in occupational settings” and “we wouldn’t expect anyone in the area to have had their health impacted”.\n\nThe affected residents, estimated at about 30, will be offered health checks.\n\nThe Government now faces political pressure over delays in alerting residents.\n\nMr Hunter on Wednesday confirmed the Government had been tracking the risk in Clovelly Park for years and been aware of elevated concentrations for several weeks.\n\nMr Hunter said the report obtained in May was audited by Government officials before he was told last week that “in an abundance of caution, we should consider options”.\n\n“I took that advice to Cabinet on Monday. Cabinet agreed to put in place a plan to talk to residents on Thursday to advise them of this latest information and to advise them that the Government would suggest they consider relocating,” Mr Hunter said.\n\nHowever, the Government was forced into immediate action late on Wednesday after the Opposition used Question Time to demand detailed answers from several ministers.\n\nPremier Jay Weatherill confirmed a “very extensive communication strategy” was being prepared but did not expand on details of the contamination discovered.\n\nLate on Wednesday, Mr Marshall said the Government had an obligation to inform people “as quickly as possible” if they were in danger. “That protocol has not been followed in this instance,” he said.\n\nIn 2010, nine residents were door-knocked and advised of testing being undertaken by Monroe, with a further 40 homes in the area letterbox dropped for information only. In 2008, residents were advised not to use bore water for any purpose after traces of TCE were found in groundwater off the Monroe and former Mitsubishi properties.\n\nAsh Ave resident Justin Pearce, 40, bought his Clovelly Park home about 15 years ago and said despite Mr Hunter personally knocking on his door last night, he felt he had been kept in the dark about testing in the area.\n\n“We had testing here last year, but it’s been six months without any information,” he said. He was last night told someone would be in contact within two weeks about moving. His biggest concern was for his two young sons.\n\n“They had ear infections and tonsillitis which (doctors) said weren’t related, but I wouldn’t be surprised.”\n\nAnother Ash Ave resident, Lisa, said she held concerns for the future health of her son, aged 10. \n\n“The long-term effects are concerning, my son was three when we moved in here. We won’t know until later what effect it’s had.”\n\nA Chestnut Ct resident of 18 years said eight people on her street had died from cancer in that time.\n\nMr Weatherill said the contamination levels were “of concern” for residents.\n\n“(But) There’s no evacuation,” Mr Weatherill said.\n\n“There’s going to be an orderly process of relocation so that the homes can be checked, made safe, hopefully people can go back into the homes they are in,” he said.\n\n“Rather than people running around frightening and alarming people we wanted to make sure they had the information in an orderly fashion and its sad that hasn’t happened.”\n\nMr Weatherill said that the Government would make sure there were no costs imposed on Housing Trust tenants to relocate but that it would consider what its responsibility was to the two private homes effected.\n\n“There are going to be steps taken to remediate (the Housing Trust properties) first we need to see whether that’s practical. If that is practical then people may be given the opportunity of being about to move back in into those home,” he said.\n\n— additional reporting Jordanna Schriever\n\nHOW IT UNFOLDED\n\nAugust 2012 — Monroe and site contamination consultant URS Australia begin indoor air and soil sampling assessments in Clovelly Park checking for TCE.\n\nFebruary 2013 — Testing finds TCE in indoor air at six properties. Monroe and URS Australia discuss the results with the Environment Protection Authority and health officials. Further testing is undertaken and TCE is found in air at three properties above acceptable levels.\n\nApril 2013 — Monroe and URS discuss the results with residents of the properties and letter drop residents in the broader area to advise of the test results and of further assessment.\n\nOctober 2013 — Further indoor air and soil tests are taken. Five more properties are found to have TCE in indoor air, bringing the total number of homes with detections to 11.\n\nDecember 2013 — Monroe and URS advise residents via a letter drop and direct discussion that the results from the testing would be used to develop a site investigation report.\n\nMay 2014 — Monroe’s health risk assessment report is given to the EPA.\n\nLast week — The EPA and health officials complete their own audit of the health risk assessment report and advise Mr Hunter they believed action was needed to safeguard residents.\n\nMonday — Cabinet agrees to alert residents on Thursday that they should leave their homes.\n\nYesterday — The Opposition raises the matter in Question Time and calls for immediate action. Within hours, Mr Hunter calls a press conference to outline the danger and advise people will be moved from their homes. EPA and health officials are sent to doorknock the area from 6pm.\n\n","byline":"STATE POLITICAL EDITOR DANIEL WILLS

for travelling in bicycle lanes for more than 50m.\n\nAmong those fined were motorcyclists and scooter riders who ducked and wove through cars and trucks banked up at traffic lights.\n\nThe data includes car and truck drivers but it is clear motorbike, scooter and even gopher riders breaking the law are at greatest risk of serious injury if collected by vehicles crossing their path.\n\nMotorists using dedicated bike lanes also pose a threat to cyclists.\n\nPolice could not break down how many motorbike, scooter or even gopher riders were included in those fined but The Advertiser photographers captured several offenders who risked a fine of $239 plus $60 Victims of Crime levy for travelling in bicycle lanes for more than 50m.\n\nA scooter rider told The Advertiser he regularly gambled by being in the bike lane or weaving through stationary traffic through frustration.\n\n“I do it a fair bit when traffic is backed up but I tend to go very slow and I’m really careful and I always look for the cars cutting over the lanes,’’ said the rider, who asked not to be named. “The biggest danger is with motorbikes that come up at speed.\n\n“But a lot scooter riders are just learning so they sit in the bike lane because it’s ... the safest place to be.’’\n\nHe said scooters with engines less than 50cc should be allowed to share the bike lanes with pushbikes.\n\nAnother scooter rider said he had stopped using bike lanes to overtake after being booked but he constantly saw others doing it.\n\n“I see a lot of people doing it but I don’t do it any more because it’s too dangerous,’’ he said.\n\nRiders weaving between lanes or overtaking on the left side of traffic are at high risk of collision if not seen by other motorists who turn left into streets or driveways, road safety experts say.\n\nPolice Traffic Support Branch Inspector Steve Kameniar said not only was it illegal for motorists to travel in bike lanes, it was also clearly dangerous.\n\n“The risk of not being seen by vehicles turning left or right across a bike lane is high,’’ he said.\n\n“The danger applies equally to bicycles and other vehicles when overtaking stationary or slow moving traffic on the left.’’\n\nMotor Accident Commission general manager for road safety Michael Cornish said motorcyclists should stick to the road rules.\n\nCycling fun as bikeway opens \n\n“Motorcycle riders are not allowed to use a bicycle lane unless they are entering or leaving a driveway or intersection,’’ he said.\n\n“Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users and by weaving in and out of traffic they increase the risk of not being seen.’’\n\nRAA traffic safety manager Charles Mountain said being in traffic jams was frustrating but it was “particularly dangerous’’ to weave through vehicles or overtake on the left.\n\n","byline":"DOUG ROBERTSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo

Australian-born children are being flown to the island this morning.\n\nAdvertiser.com.au believes four families are Burmese and one is Tamil.\n\nAt least 71 babies have been or will be sent to Christmas Island after their asylum seeker mothers were brought to the mainland to give birth.\n\nLast month eight families were woken before dawn to leave the Adelaide Hills detention centre and go to Christmas Island, where advocates say they face poor health facilities, cramped conditions including shared bathrooms, and fear they will be sent on to Nauru or Manus Island.\n\nA spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was a “normal transfer process” and that the youngest child was “approximately eight weeks of age”.\n\nThere were 14 people in four families being sent to Christmas Island, he said.\n\n“The Minister is advised the families have no further medical treatment required and have been deemed fit to return to Christmas Island,” he said.\n\n“Such transfers are subject to medical clearances.\n\n“The Minister is advised the detainees were notified in advance of the transfer and were not prevented from contacting family, friends or others prior to their departure from Inverbrackie.”\n\nThe latest development comes as pressures grows to strip Mr Morrison of his guardianship responsibilities for asylum seeker children as a dozen remain missing in Adelaide.\n\nClive Palmer, whose party holds the balance of power in the Senate, has joined the Greens move to replace Scott Morrison with an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors.\n\nHuman Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs is also in favour, declaring it a “conflict of interest”.\n\nTwo unaccompanied minors living in the northern suburbs were picked up by Immigration late last week and put into detention, which prompted 12 other asylum seekers to flee in fear of meeting the same fate.\n\nGreens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young will introduce a Bill as early as next week to establish an independent Guardian for Unaccompanied Children.\n\nShe said Mr Morrison should not be both “guardian and jailer”.\n\n“The Minister’s deafening silence on this issue (of the missing children) is of great concern as he is ultimately responsible for the safety and welfare of these children,” she said.\n\n“It is clear that the Minister’s obsession with secrecy is clouding his proper judgment to act in the best interest of these children.”\n\nMr Palmer agreed it was a “mistake” to have Mr Morrison fulfilling both duties and will discuss the matter with his three senators.\n\n“He has a joint role; he has to make decisions … I think it’s a good idea (to have an independent guardian),” he said.\n\n“Our policy is that they (asylum seekers) can fly in, have a hearing the same day at the airport and if they’re not genuine, fly them home.\n\n“I think it’s a bad thing (to keep children in detention) — that may affect them for the rest of their lives.”\n\nLabor’s position is not yet clear.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Morrison said he had “continued the practice of previous ministers in exercising these responsibilities”.\n\nProfessor Triggs said she had personally told Mr Morrison that it was a conflict of interest and that he should pass the responsibility on to someone else.\n\n“How can he possibly make a decision that holding them on Christmas Island, or to send them to Nauru is in their best interest?” she asked.\n\nAt a Human Rights Commission hearing into children in detention yesterday, Prof Triggs heard from a range of witnesses that it was detention itself that caused high levels of self harm and mental illness in asylum seeker children, not just the trauma they suffered in their homelands or on the perilous journey to Australia.\n\nThe Commission has collected drawings from some of the almost 1000 children in detention where they depict themselves behind bars, crying, and asking for help.\n\nMr Morrison’s spokesman said the department would work with the community detention service provider and SAPOL to “relocate missing detainees”.\n\n","byline":"TORY SHEPHERD POLITICAL

be required to work a major event on Friday, July 25, at Adelaide Oval.\n\nA July clash is the perfect off-season preparation for European clubs and the Reds, who host Melbourne Victory on October 17 at Adelaide Oval.\n\nNeither AFL clubs Adelaide or Port Adelaide play at Adelaide Oval in the last weekend of July.\n\nAdelaide United’s former Barcelona youth coach Josep Gombau enjoys a bulging contact book from Argentine great Lionel Messi to the greats of Spain’s golden generation.\n\nHowever, it is Gombau’s links with La Liga officials that stand to deliver a slice of overdue football heaven.\n\nSouth Australia was outflanked by eastern states and Canberra who will host Tim Cahill’s Socceroos in Asian Cup fixtures through January 2015.\n\nThe Spanish government is using glamour La Liga clubs to spread its “culture and brand”.\n\nThis month’s exhibition game could lead to Adelaide’s possible inclusion in a Spanish-run LFP World Club summer tournament.\n\nMalaga could also play against Perth Glory this month.\n\nLuring one of the Spanish big three, Real Madrid, Barcelona or Atletico Madrid would be an outlandish coup.\n\nHowever, high calibre outfits such Javi Gracia’s Malaga would pack a venue that has been restricted to cricket and AFL fixtures since the completion of a $535 million, tax-payer funded upgrade.\n\nMalaga — supported by many English expats along the “coast of the sun” — boast the likes of former Bayern Munich and Manchester City striker Roque Santa Cruz, and Liverpool loan forward Luis Alberto on the books.\n\nGombau has spent the off-season in Catalonia where he met with La Liga officials and searched for players and expertise to bolster the Reds.\n\nLanding La Liga opposition for the Reds in a one-off or ongoing arrangement would provide a massive boost at Hindmarsh and game in general.\n\nGombau is preparing for a busy pre-season, appointed to steer the A-League All-Stars against Italian powerhouse Juventus at ANZ Stadium on 10 August.\n\nA La Liga side taking on the Reds adds lustre to an A-League that is set to welcome Spanish super star David Villa and England stalwart Frank Lampard at Melbourne City this season.\n\n","byline":"RICHARD EARLE ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/A-League News/Adelaide

I was surprised by the number that did,’ he said.\n\n“I have no idea how many, but it was probably more than 50 ... it was pretty weird.”\n\nMr Pfeiffer, who is still single, said he would rather meet women face-to-face, adding they were welcome to “come up to Whistler Wines”.\n\nCharlie Bainger, 30 of Robe, who has since landed himself “a really nice girl”, said his phone went “ballistic” after he appeared on the small screen.\n\n“I run a surf school so my number is pretty readily available,” he said.\n\n“I was getting messages on the phone and on Facebook from people saying ‘I’d love to catch up’ ... to the point I had to turn it off.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kangaroo Island mechanic and farmer Thomas Oak, 31, had women travelling to meet him.\n\n“I got the heads-up from the tourist information centre here that a couple of women were calling up about accommodation on the island and mentioned my name a couple of times,” he said.\n\nOne particularly keen lady turned up at his workshop, her bags at the ready.\n\n“It was flattering and scary at the same time ... I’m just an island boy,” he said.\n\n","byline":"Jessica Galletly ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and photos/","/display/news.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photo/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Entertainment News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/display/perthnow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA News and Photos/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/south-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T10:26:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T10:26:57.000Z","description":"THE show may be over, but love is still coming to town for the men involved in Nine’s reality TV dating experiment.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fnii5yv6-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fnii5yv5-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fnii5yv4-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fnii5yv7-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fni6umbp-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fnii5yv8-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"4ad98c46b1632fa661f6cee2e95b4889","keywords":["Kangaroo Island","South Australia","Australia","Facebook","Inc.","Josh Pfeiffer","Jessica Galletly","dating experiment","single women tour","women travelling","female fans","Valley winemaker","rural bachelors","eligible bachelors","nice girl","tourist information centre"],"kicker":"Television","link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/reality-is-these-rural-bachelors-from-when-love-comes-to-town-are-now-rock-stars/story-fni6umbp-1226975632533?sv=fb56b117f90324ab83cd41dae1ecbf23","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975632533","originalSource":"The Advertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN SA Photo galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ef598eb2345554329d326a8a7bafacfa","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975632020","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"22f71c17c3a4032ef8092b2e7f24c94e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975632046","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE show may be over, but love is still coming to town for the South Australian men involved in Nine’s reality TV dating experiment.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Reality is, these rural bachelors from When Love Comes to Town are now rock stars","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Dylan Coker"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Reality is, these rural bachelors are rock stars","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"c890ef12-0195-11e4-9138-9da47e60188f -

He’s undersized, there’s no doubt about that, but he makes up for it with his competitiveness.”\n\nThe last time Port played without Carlile and Trengove in an AFL game was round 12, 2009. While the Power had a taste of playing without them in the preseason, their absence comes at an awkward time given the size of Bomber forwards Joe Daniher and Jake Carlisle.\n\n“Carlisle is in good marking form and Daniher is going to be a superstar,” Nicks said.\n\nBut Port will also look to turn the match-ups in to a positive, using any advantage they have in speed and mobility to run off the Essendon forwards.\n\n“When you play against a really tall forward line it’s a scary thought if the ball keeps coming in the air over and over,” Nicks said.\n\n“But from a positive point of view, if you can get the ball on the ground you’ve got the ability to move it out quicker.”\n\nPort defender Jasper Pittard said Carlile and Trengove would be missed but echoed Ken Hinkley’s message that the Power don’t rely on individuals.\n\n“They’ve been rock solid for us all year,” Pittard said.\n\n“But we’re not a personnel-based team — that’s the mantra Kenny drives.\n\n“I’m not sure who the coaches will go for but Cam O’Shea and Tom Clurey are more than capable of playing the key position roles.”\n\n","byline":"Jai Bednall

Adelaide Oval — regaining control of its September dream in the process.\n\nThe false dawns will be behind ninth-placed Adelaide with successive victories against the Giants at Spotless Stadium.\n\n“Our heads are still above water, still in the race and only one game out of the eight so our destiny is in our own hands,” 259-game veteran Thompson told The Advertiser.\n\n“It was the biggest win of the season so we have shown enough when we do get it together.\n\n“Hopefully we can take a lot of confidence and self belief within the group that we are good enough and get the ball rolling.”\n\nPort won contested possessions 154-128 in its March Showdown victory but Adelaide turned the tables with a 163-133 advantage on Sunday.\n\nThompson sees the green shoots of a Crows recovery as they target back-to-back wins for the first time since round six after a run of success against St Kilda, GWS and Western Bulldogs.\n\n“We are getting better but are still patchy and that is what we need to get rid of. Our best footy is good enough. Against Port we played four quarters,” said Thompson, who kicked his 150th goal against the Power.\n\n“It was a gutsy win. There is no doubt we were heavy underdogs, they sat top for a reason.\n\n“When you have weight of numbers you will win more often than not.”\n\nThompson is in white hot form – gathering 34 touches, seven tackles and a goal against Port – only shaded by ruckman Sam Jacobs in Showdown medal voting.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield’s 22 contested possessions and Rory Sloane’s nine influential tackles dismantled Port in a hand-to-hand midfield combat.\n\n“They have a quality midfield and lot of guys who can roll through there but I thought our midfield was outstanding the way we pressured the ball, hunted the footy and balance around the contest was quite good,” said Thompson.\n\n“It is always good when the big boy hits the scoreboard. Not only is he a very good ruckman off the hand but reads the play well for a big guy,” said Thompson of Jacobs, who also earnt 10 AFL coaches association votes.\n\n“I am enjoying my footy, we have a great young group together.”\n\nBrad Crouch and Matthew Wright also excelled against Port with Thompson sensing a solidification of the playing group ahead of the Giants clash.\n\nThompson predicted four-goal hero Eddie Betts’s second half of the season “will be even better” than the first and implored fans to keep the faith after what has been a bumpy ride.\n\n“We do owe the supporters a big thank you and hope they do stick with us. We are trying to get off that rollercoaster and can hopefully string a few wins together,” said Thompson.\n\n","byline":"RICHARD EARLE

and West Coast’s Darren Glass as the hardest to beat.\n\nRutten might not receive the interstate kudos that the others enjoy but make no mistake, he is a top-notch defender.\n\n“Truck’’ ranks alongside Ben Hart as the best two defenders the Adelaide Crows have ever produced.\n\nThey are completely different players but they are too good to split.\n\nHart was more versatile in that he was able to play on big-bodied key forwards like Tony Lockett, Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett Snr but he was unique in that he could also quell elusive, smaller forwards like Phil Matera, Brad Johnson and Jeff Farmer.\n\nWhile Rutten has made his name playing on the power forwards of the competition — Barry Hall, David Neitz, Matthew Richardson and Jonathan Brown to name a few — he has been one of the best lockdown defenders in the game.\n\nAfter originally being ignored in the national draft, Rutten had to work hard for his chance at fulfilling his childhood dream of playing AFL.\n\nAdelaide used its 40th pick at the 2002 rookie draft to select the man it later nicknamed Truck because of his size.\n\nIt is one of the best recruiting decisions it ever made.\n\nPlaying 225 games is no mean feat. And Rutten will hope to add a few more to his record before the year is out.\n\nThe Ben Rutten story is not only one of perseverance but also one of getting the very best out of yourself.\n\nHe has never been a track animal, joking at his retirement press conference that he has a large turning circle.\n\nBut this hasn’t mattered. The 190cm, 98kg Rutten turned himself from an immobile key forward into one of the most competitive and disciplined defenders in the game.\n\nHe became a genuine defender — not one of those pseudo, drop-off, uncontested defenders we see nowadays, who struggle to spoil when isolated one on one.\n\nRutten has thrived on taking on the opposition’s main man and beating him in a one-on-one contest, burying the incoming ball with a strong defensive fist.\n\nFormer coach Neil Craig’s defence-first game plan and Rutten was a match made in heaven. Between 2005 and 2007, Adelaide’s defence was a vault and nightmare to play against and Truck was the key.\n\nHe would lock down on the opposition’s best forward, Nathan Bock would attack from half-back and Nathan Bassett would drop off to air-assist as the third man in a marking contest.\n\nThrow in Michael Doughty, Jason Torney, Graham Johncock and resting midfielders like Andrew McLeod, Tyson Edwards and Simon Goodwin and scoring was hard to come by.\n\nWithout ever seeing it first-hand I could tell Rutten was a diligent player who studied his opponent’s strengths and weaknesses because he was rarely beaten the same way twice in a row.\n\nHe was also smart, his positioning was second to none and he rarely lost sight of the moving ball and his opponent.\n\nDefenders who lose sight of either one usually get cut up.\n\nRutten’s timing and ability to cut off the leading forward by cutting the angle has been brilliant and something that has assisted his game as father time has begun to catch up with him.\n\nHe has spoiled with both fists — preferred and non-preferred — which is something not always seen in today’s game. And his closing speed and first 10m out of the blocks has never been given enough credit.\n\nAs an opposition player, I was always confident of having Rutten covered for fitness, agility and speed. But exposing those perceived weaknesses wasn’t easy.\n\nTrying to wrestle him out of position in a marking contest was even harder. Truck ensured he wouldn’t go down without a fight, no matter the scoreline.\n\nNo doubt his vocal leadership will also be missed in Adelaide’s defensive half when his career is over.\n\nIn the meantime, he can still be of value to the Crows — whether on the field or off it.\n\nAdelaide’s young defenders Daniel Talia and Kyle Hartigan must pick his brain.\n\nAbsorbing as much defensive know-how in the next three months will be vital to their long term development before Rutten is lost to West Lakes.\n\nThe same goes for Taylor Walker and his fellow forwards. Gun defenders can teach you everything you need to know about what makes a great forward tick — how to move, where to lead and a few of the tricks about getting split on your opposition.\n\nThey have had a first-class seat in trailing the best key forwards in the game.\n\nAll you need to do is ask them two questions: What do you hate them doing and how do they do it?\n\nBen Rutten is without doubt an unheralded defensive star.\n\nHe will be sorely missed, but knowing what I do of this on-field warrior there will be a little candle still burning inside him waiting for one final fling on the big stage.\n\nEnjoy retirement when it comes around. It was a pleasure playing against you.\n\nWarren Tredrea is Port Adelaide’s 2004 premiership captain, a Channel 9 News sports presenter, Triple M Football commentator and Australian Football Hall of

to ban tattoo parlours and sex shops from Glenelg  in case they “ruin the family feel” of the place.\n\nNever mind that no one actually seems to want to open up a sex shop in Glenelg, or that the one tattoo joint already on Jetty Rd doesn’t seem to hurt anyone.\n\nNo, according to Holdfast Bay councillors, Glenelg is Adelaide’s answer to Disneyland and must be protected from indecency at all costs.\n\n“You don’t want these sort of things setting up because tourists won’t want to go there,” Cr Mikki Bouchee told The Guardian Messenger on Monday.\n\n“It’s also in anticipation of brothels maybe becoming legalised. I don’t think we’ve got strong enough policies to stop this sort of shop from going ahead.”\n\nAnd there we have it folks, the real heart of the issue.\n\nHoldfast Bay’s sudden concern about “sex and sleaze infiltrating family-friendly areas” has nothing to do with tattoo parlours and adult shops, and everything to do with MP Steph Key’s fresh bid to decriminalise prostitution in this state.\n\nAs reported last week in The Advertiser, Ms Key is drafting her third attempt at decriminalising sex work in South Australia  after her last Bill was defeated by one vote in 2012.\n\nShe tried again in 2013 with an updated version of that Bill, but it was never heard because parliamentary sitting time ran out before the March election.\n\nThank goodness then that the clear-headed residents of Ashford voted Ms Key back in, giving her another chance to launch new legislation to decriminalise all forms of sex work including at home, in brothels, through escort services and on the street.\n\nThey obviously agreed with her plan and so, it seems, do readers of The Advertiser; a poll on last week’s story attracted 2225 votes, the majority of which — 76 per cent — were in favour of decriminalising sex work. Less than a quarter voted to keep prostitution illegal in SA.\n\nGiven this survey’s more than reasonable sample size, I’d say it’s a fair reflection of public sentiment on the matter. It’s not a feeling that’s just popped up overnight, either.\n\nQueensland has had legal brothels since 1992, Victoria since 1994. New South Wales has been fully decriminalised since 1996. And yet here we are, with our dusty old laws — some of which date back to 1935 — dictating what people can and can’t do with their bodies and where.\n\nThe very fact that some of our legislation still refers to brothels as “bawdy houses” should be enough to convince us it is no longer effective in a modern world.\n\nCurrently SA sex workers can be charged with running a brothel for seeing a client in their home. Known sex workers can be, and have been, charged with loitering for just walking down the street. They don’t have access to WorkCover, and are seen as easy targets for assault and robbery because they’re less likely to report to police. It is also legal to discriminate against a current or former sex worker.\n\nThis is a clear human rights issue, and yet legislative change has been continually stymied for decades by so many of our elected leaders who confuse the discussion with irrelevant questions of morality, or who adopt a “not in my backyard” mentality — just like those at Holdfast Bay council appear to be doing.\n\nFretting about brothels “ruining the family feel” of an area, or worrying about how close they are to churches, is an old-fashioned attitude that stems from a lack of understanding of how the sex industry works.\n\nIn most cases such “brothels” are actually sex workers’ private homes, and guess what — they’re already quietly operating over the suburbs. Some are probably next to churches. You might even have one on your street. Bothered? Why should you be? I bet you didn’t even realise they were there.\n\nIt will be a scarlet-letter day when Ms Key’s Bill eventually passes. We must not allow outdated attitudes and moralistic hand-wringing by councils to render it useless.\n\n","byline":"Petra Starke ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Opinion/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"adelaidenow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T14:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T23:17:25.000Z","description":"ADELAIDE long ago shed its reputation as being the “city of churches”, but you’d never know it the way some of our elected leaders like to moralise about certain issues.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/petra-starke-fretting-about-brothels-ruining-the-family-feel-of-an-area-is-an-oldfashioned-attitude/story-fni6unxq-1226975557922?sv=863c9e026e90b9473527d965e77d9a11","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"cd1ecd47d77dfc74ad3068ab2afbb59a","keywords":["moralistic hand-wringing","clear human rights","clear-headed residents","outdated attitudes","Glenelg","Victoria","Australia","Facebook","Inc.","Ari Reid","sudden concern","fresh bid","sex industry workers","sex industry works","parliamentary sitting time","decriminalising sex","sexual services","irrelevant questions","sex workers","sex industry","tattoo parlours","old-fashioned attitude","sex shops","decriminalise prostitution","adult shops","human rights issue","private homes","South Australia","Holdfast Bay","New South Wales"],"kicker":"Petra Starke","link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/petra-starke-fretting-about-brothels-ruining-the-family-feel-of-an-area-is-an-oldfashioned-attitude/story-fni6unxq-1226975557922?sv=863c9e026e90b9473527d965e77d9a11","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975557922","originalAssetId":"1226975557922","originalSource":"The Advertiser","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/adelaidenow.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN Opinion/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f111fe4620702cfb01a63e94d05e2d12","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975558156","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"SUDDEN concern about sex shops in Glenelg has nothing to do with keeping it family-friendly, and everything to do with a fresh bid to decriminalise prostitution in SA.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Petra Starke: Fretting about brothels ruining the family feel of an area is an old-fashioned attitude","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Time Adelaide had a sex-attitude change","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"1da36bbc-019e-11e4-aaf7-dc6e5517e581 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["picture","Petra Starke","Clayton Nick"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/adelaidenow/images/1226976051959?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226976051959","originalSource":"News Limited","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226976051933","subtitle":"1da36bbc-019e-11e4-aaf7-dc6e5517e581","title":"Methode Byline headshots, dinkus for journalist Petra Starke.

network is using a crowd noise meter to measure the decibel level.\n\nCrowd noise has been a major talking point of the new stadium this season and last month the Power used a recording of a match-day crowd while training.\n\n“It’s a pretty special sound,” midfielder Hamish Hartlett said.\n\n“When we first run out and the crowd erupts it really inspires us to make sure we play well and even when things aren’t going so well the crowd can spur us on to get the momentum back in our favour.\n\n“We rely on them a fair bit and we certainly gain plenty out of them making heaps of noise.\n\n“In previous years we haven’t had heaps of people at our games so having 40 or 50,000 has made a fair bit of difference but I think the way the stadium is built it traps the sound in.”\n\nPort’s biggest crowd at the Oval this year was in Round 10 when 52,233 — more than either Showdown attendance this season — packed the ground to see the Power play Hawthorn in a major endorsement of hosting Saturday night footy.\n\n“I remember every time we kicked a goal or something significant happened, when the crowd erupted it was just incredible,” Hartlett said.\n\n“That and the Geelong game were two that really stood out and the Showdown in Round 2.\n\n“When the crowd is in full voice it’s quite difficult to hear anything else going on out on the field but we wouldn’t want it any other way to be honest.\n\n“We’ve got to make sure we’re swivelling our head and taking in everything that’s going on around us.\n\n“Making sure we keep track of what’s going on in the backline and forward line, just more awareness with our eyes.”\n\nAs for whether the Power is any chance of beating the Guinness World Record of 137.6 decibels set by NFL side the Seattle Seahawks’ crowd in 2013, Hartlett said it would take an absolute full house.\n\n“It would take every seat to be filled and all the standing room to be full as well,” he said.\n\n“We’re hoping for a huge crowd which would go a long way and then something special to happen like Chaddy’s (Wingard) mark against St Kilda to get the crowd up and about.”\n\n","byline":"REECE HOMFRAY

grant its support.\n\nThe $896 million South Rd upgrade from Torrens Rd to the River Torrens relies on $448 million of Federal Government funding.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Infrastructure Minister Stephen Mullighan released the Project Assessment Report which revealed changes to the upgrade including leaving an electrical substation in place and stopping right turns on the Port Rd from South Rd.\n\n“We (the Federal Government) haven’t seen the plan and weren’t told about the announcement,” Mr Briggs said.\n\n“There are reasonable changes to what was originally planned. Because we haven’t seen it we can’t say if we support it and our money is contingent on our support.\n\n“I expressed concern to the Minister (Mullighan). The national partnership agreement says when we are funding a project like this 50/50 (split between Federal and State funding) any plans need to be consulted with us and any announcement needs to be done in conjunction with us.\n\n“I wouldn’t overstate there is any risk to the project but when we are committing taxpayer funding, especially of this size, we need to make sure we are getting value.”\n\nMr Briggs said he also had his office express the same concerns to the state infrastructure department to ensure this did not happen again.\n\n“The Minister (Mullighan) explained it was a mix up so that’s what I have put it down to,” Mr Briggs said.\n\nA key point of difference between both major parties during the Federal Election campaign last year was which end of South Rd to upgrade.\n\nThe Federal Liberal Party promised to upgrade Darlington, while Federal Labor was committed to the Torrens to Torrens project.\n\nThe issue continued to be fiercely debated following the election with the SA Labor Government continuing to pursue Torrens to Torrens despite the Federal Liberal Government’s commitment to Darlington until the Federal Budget revealed both projects would proceed.\n\nWhen asked why the State Government did not consult the Federal Government on the changes to the Torrens to Torrens project, Mr Mullighan said the relevant Federal Department had provided input to the changes.\n\n“It should be noted this is the next iteration of the project design; the design will be finalised once consultation on the Project Assessment Report is considered,” Mr Mullighan said.\n\n“We have made Minister Briggs’s office aware of the opportunity to be involved in the announcement of the final project design.”\n\n","byline":"Political Reporter Sheradyn

his failed company Nova Real Estate claimed $6 million in compensation from him.\n\nNova RE liquidator Andrew Heard sought the compensation as damages from Mr Nowak for trading while being insolvent.\n\n“In our investigations into the liquidation, we found him guilty of incurring debt at the time of being insolvent,” Mr Heard said.\n\nA South Australian investor has filed a claim for $125,000, after investing her and her mum’s super into Mr Nowak’s entities.\n\n“It’s a body blow. I feel gutted by this and the fact that he was taking our money to pay all his debts and at such a vulnerable time in our lives.\n\n“He came in just after my dad passed away from lung cancer and me and my mum were in turmoil,” she said.\n\nCo-director of Nova RE Dianne Westthorp is also facing a compensation claim from creditors and investors.\n\nPeter Macks of Macks Advisory has been appointed trustee of Mr Nowak’s estate.\n\nMr Macks advised that investigations into the affairs of Mr Nowak are well underway, but believed any return to creditors is unlikely at this stage.\n\nIn the Statement of Affairs lodged with the trustee, Mr Nowak has listed 31 companies where he was or is a director and or shareholder.\n\n“Unsecured creditors totals approximately $7 million substantially which includes a claim in his estate brought by the Liquidators of Nova Real Estate Pty Ltd of approximately $6 million.”\n\n“Most of his wealth seems to be in his shareholding of the companies and all the properties that the companies own are currently sold or being sold at shortfalls,” he said.\n\nMr Nowak’s multimillion-dollar luxury Springfield home with 17 car spaces, a “batcave”, swimming pool and tennis court — bought by him for $4.26 million in 2012 — was sold by a major bank last month for $3.26 million.\n\nIn February, the Federal Court seized the assets and passports of Mr Nowak and his wife Betty Dawn Nowak pending an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission into the collapse of four entities linked to them.\n\nThat investigation is ongoing and likely to be completed before an early November ASIC court hearing.\n\nO’Loughlins lawyer Michael Connelly said the law firm was still trying to get access to insurance paperwork on behalf of its 50 clients, but was still considering a number of options, including a class action.\n\nA property search has revealed a number of properties, potentially worth millions, being held under the names of the other entities related to George and Betty Nowak, including Harralex Nominees and Harralex Homes.\n\nMost investors have sunk money into different entities within Mr Nowak’s complex empire built around investment property proposals — not just the ones that have collapsed.\n\nThe Charterhill Group operated as a “one-stop shop”, providing advice to clients on the establishment of self-managed superannuation funds, rollover of existing super funds into an SMSF, sourcing and purchase of investment properties, property management, insurance and taxation.\n\nFour known entities of Mr Nowak are believed to have collapsed — Nova Real Estate, Lending Solutions International, EJ Property Developments and Financial Wellness (EZ Residential) — and he has separately informed investors his rental guarantee company Australian Leasecorp has also stopped trading.\n\n","byline":"VALERINA CHANGARATHIL ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/AdelaideNow/AN

Farm, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court today by video link.\n\nHe has yet to plead to one basic count of causing serious harm by dangerous driving.\n\nCourt documents allege Chicarella was behind the wheel of a stolen V8 Commodore that caused Mr Milisits to fall outside his famed Mile End business, Cafe De Vili’s, in April .\n\nHe had allegedly met the car’s owner in the cafe car park for a test drive, only to snatch the keys and speed off after pushing the owner over.\n\nMr Milisits was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries.\n\nLast week, Chicarella asked the court to order a report so that their client could seek release on home detention bail .\n\nToday Richard Talbot, for Chicarella, said his client was withdrawing that application.\n\n“I had spoken to the woman who is the occupant of the address we had put down as suitable (for home detention bail) at Seaton,” he said.\n\n“She had spoken to me, I had spoken to her, before we put the application in.\n\n“In the meantime she’s apparently changed her mind and does not wish for my client to live with her.”\n\nMr Talbot said he had also approached Chicarella’s mother.\n\n“She might have been a possible alternative, however for other reasons she’s not able to have him at her address either,” he said.\n\nHe asked his client be given leave to apply for bail at short notice should a suitable address be found.\n\nThe state’s chief magistrate, Judge Elizabeth Bolton, agreed and remanded Chicarella in custody to answer the charge at the end of this month.\n\n","byline":"Chief Court Reporter Sean

its best, and will also apply a heavy tag on whoever turns out to be the Bombers’ most damaging midfielder.\n\nAssistant coach Josh Carr, a premiership player with plenty of tricks in that area, said Kane Cornes would most likely be shuffled between playmakers such as Dyson Heppell, David Zaharakis, Brendan Goddard and Brent Stanton.\n\nIt comes as tagging has come back into fashion — provided the tagger can find his own ball - after some coaches and commentators read him his last rights during the time of rapid growth of interchange use.\n\n“It’s up to us as a team — the whole team — to respond,’’ Carr said.\n\n“They (Essedon) have played some really good football this year, were really against Geelong and their best is really good.\n\n“We have to be on top of our game.’’\n\nThe tagging part will be one of constant evaluations.\n\nCarr said there were a number of players that could get away from the Power.\n\nThe key was not to let too many of them get away on the outside.\n\n“Sometimes there are players we pick out (to tag) during the week but you’ve also got to be prepared to make in-game adjustments,’’ Carr said.\n\n“I think they move the ball very well, very sharply and very direct\n\n“For us to be at our best we need to defend well.\n\n“We know that Essendon’s very good at the uncontested footy and like to hold on to the ball. We’ve got to be ready for that.’’\n\nPort will miss key defenders Jackson Trengove and Alipate Carlile to injury but is confident there is enough depth to cover for the club’s best two defenders, with Tom Clurey and Tom Jonas expected to fill the key posts.\n\n“You expect somebody to come into the team and step up,’’ Carr said.\n\n“And we’ll see how we come from here.\n\n“It’s obviously a hit, but I think we’ve shown all year that, especially with the ankles, that we’ve had guys who have come in and played their roles.\n\n“There’s not really much you can do about it. It’s bad luck; it’s football.\n\n“There are 18 teams out there who have had their fair share of injuries.’’\n\n","byline":"Jesper Fjeldstad

The new DCP will have a wood shop, metalworks and a bakery which will be used to train inmates for future careers in a variety of fields.\n\nMr Elferink says the inmates will produce manufactured products in fields that do not compete with private business in the Territory. It’s about getting them working and cutting down on repeat offenders.\n\n“So that we use prisoners to develop a work ethic so that when they leave jail, they have something more than when they entered jail,” Mr Elferink said. “And often that’s just something to lose. We’ll make damn certain they have every opportunity to make something of themselves.”\n\nThe delayed $495 million prison will have enough beds for 1048 inmates, more than the 835 currently incarcerated in Berrimah. That prison was originally constructed in 1979 to hold 110.\n\nDCP general manager Bill Carroll said despite the clean, bright complex, inmates would not have a soft ride.\n\n“It’s all about regime. If prisoners don’t comply, if they don’t engage in education or programs to address their offending behaviour … then they won’t have the same opportunities as that of the prisoners who do,” he said.\n\n“The regime here is quite strict and the prisoners will have to get used to it.”\n\nMr Elferink says it’s all part of the Government’s new working prisons policy.\n\n“We have come a long way from the ‘rack and stack’ model of previous corrections facilities where prisoners are simply locked in their cells with little to no focus on rehabilitation,” he said.\n\nPenalty clauses worked into the contract with construction consortium Sentinel means the Government will save $165,000 a day for every day they are not in the new building. That could work out to $10 million in savings over the next two months.\n\n","byline":"By CHRISTOPHER WALSH ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/themercury.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/northern-territory/","/section/themercury.com.au/news/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"ntnews.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T09:06:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T09:08:12.000Z","description":"THE inmates at the Darwin Correctional Centre at Berrimah were in a frisky mood yesterday, so Correctional Services Minister John Elferink took an exaggerated bow during a media tour of Darwin’s correctional institutions.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xx-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xv-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnn3gfdo-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.themercury.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xy-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"themercury.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk0b1zt-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"ntnews.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5y0-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xw-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xz-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","themercury.com.au","ntnews.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"b64a3369c01c71313bced940f80ea5c1","keywords":["correctional institutions","maximum security cell","construction consortium","nastiest criminals","working prisons policy","healthy eating choices","Grant Ballantine","John Elferink","medium security","corrections facilities","medium security section","maximum security","frisky mood","medium security cages","private business","work experience","Penalty clauses","Northern Territory","Australia","Correctional Services Inc.","Bill Carroll"],"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/minister-takes-a-bow-as-prisoners-cheer-him-on/story-fnk1w5xw-1226974223622?sv=cbf26d829de2808d6ecb2d846fdaef7b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974223622","originalSource":"NTNews","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"790228a537f907f26734227094be4162","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974223516","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"4a8ca7b1e8dc3bdfce34ab5c6185b5a0","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974223568","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE inmates at the Darwin Correctional Centre at Berrimah had been in a frisky mood.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Minister takes a bow as prisoners cheer him on","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Justin Sanson"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Captive audience star","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"06bfa548-0025-11e4-b272-fb6ce70c69e9 -

You go over the there you’ll get 4000 people sticking crackers in very direction.\n\n“I just love the colours.”\n\nDarryl’s mates chimes in that it’s about adrenalin and sticks a cracker in my hand.\n\n“I’ll light, you throw it,” he said.\n\n“Can you throw?”\n\n“Where am I throwing it?\n\n“That a-way.”\n\nAnd like a grenade in my hand I did. It looked small. “Boom!”.\n\n“It feels good, doesn’t it? That’s why we do it.”\n\nI felt it through my body. It was about adrenalin.\n\nBut Darryl had a softer take on it.\n\n“The whole town comes together mate,” he said.\n\n“If you’re not on the beach, you’re in your yard setting off crackers. It brings the town and all the families out mate.\n\n“This might be the only night of the year where no one’s sitting at home on their iPad or playing computer games. All the kids are out and about for a change.\n\n“It will never end and I don’t want it to. No way in the world.”’\n\nSo you sit and wonder how many people $300,000 could feed?\n\nAnd then someone retorts, “Yes, but it also fed a fair bit of Territory pride.

to Melbourne and didn’t know what else to do.\n\nThese are some of the more interesting calls with which the NT police Communications Unit must deal on a daily basis.\n\nAnd Senior Sergeant Craig Laidler has asked Territorians to think carefully about calling triple-zero, especially on a busy day like Territory Day.\n\nHe said triple-zero is reserved for emergencies, and time-wasters can delay a genuine call from reaching help.\n\n“A lot of calls are urgent requirements for emergency services because things do go wrong with fireworks sometimes and fire services have to attend,” he said.\n\n“Triple-zero is used for serious and life-threatening calls, but a lot are noise complaints, dogs, noise, fireworks in general, people calling you to tell us fireworks are being set off and that they’ve had enough.”\n\nREAD: IDIOT 000 CALLERS CLOG EMERGENCY LINE IN BLACK OUT \n\nHe said last Territory Day, the call centre got about 2200 calls – 1300 of which were between the legal fireworks time of 6pm and 11am. There will be 20 staff rostered on tonight.\n\nHe said grassfires, injuries, and dangerous situations warranted a triple-zero call.\n\n“If there is six other people there with mobile phones it helps to discuss it with them to see who will call,” he said.\n\n“We just ask people to consider the necessity of a call to emergency services.\n\n“You would be amazed.”\nAnd what about the aliens in the fridge?\n\n“We discussed it with him and police attended because they were concerned with the state of his mental health,” Sen-Sgt Laidler said.\n\n“We know not everyone is a fan of Territory Day, but we don’t need all these people to ring emergency services.”\n\n“If a property is on fire, we need to know. But we get a lot of prank and abusive calls. They start amicably and then go into a tirade of abuse about police or firies.”\n\n","byline":"By CONOR BYRNE ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/themercury.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/themercury.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/northern-territory/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"ntnews.com.au","dateLive":"2014-06-30T04:57:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T04:27:41.000Z","description":"A MAN has called emergency line 000 because he thought there were aliens in his fridge.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xx-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xv-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.themercury.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xy-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"themercury.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnn3gfdo-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk0b1zt-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"ntnews.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5y0-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xz-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xw-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","themercury.com.au","news.com.au","ntnews.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"977fda1c38b9c9ebc73e8e631cf0b81f","keywords":["triple zero","call centre","interesting calls","genuine call","fire services","mobile phones","Melbourne","Victoria","Australia","emergency line","emergency services","people calling","urgent requirements","legal fireworks time","mental health","abusive calls","dangerous situations"],"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/help-theres-aliens-hiding-in-my-fridge/story-fnk1w5xz-1226973364493?sv=3e8cfec805635ddfcc1aa42680801c1c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973364493","originalAssetId":"1226973364493","originalSource":"NTNews","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"18a35be99c641f60dbdbf6c691cc7753","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973364014","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"DARWIN residents seem confused about the purpose of 000.

I know that’s what we get paid for.”\n\nHe urged Territorians to think about the professions who work for their safety.\n\n“Please have a safe night and weekend so the shift workers can have a little down time,” he said. “But most importantly – If I had my time over, I would do it all again.”\n\n","byline":"By CONOR BYRNE

liquor licensing and pokies in remote indigenous communities with the Federal Government.\n\n“You’ve got to wonder what thought process is happening in the CLP when they’re putting revenue raising ahead of community safety,” Labor Leader Delia Lawrie said.\n\n“The Giles Government seems addicted to poker ­machine revenue and oblivious to the social harm.”\n\nMr Tollner says the issue comes down to freedom of choice and fundamental rights for people in current dry ­communities.\n\n“Is Labor saying Aboriginal people should not have the same rights as everybody else?” Mr Tollner said yesterday in an email to the NT News.\n\nREAD: TERRITORIANS GAMBLE $611M ON POKIES IN 2013 \n\n“That Aboriginal people should be banned from access to alcohol or gambling, or that drinking and gambling isn’t going on now?”\n\nMr Tollner said the Government is committed to trying to remove the barrier for so-called “social clubs” in remote communities. He added the endeavour is in response to people he says were “embarrassed” that their communities were shrinking as people flocked to other cities for grog.\n\n“We think that social clubs on communities can reduce the number of people leaving communities and at the same time allow greater community responsibility of drinking,” he said.\n\nMs Lawrie says if the CLP plans to introduce pokies and pubs to bush communities, they should first complete a social impact assessment. But, she added, reports into the issue of gambling and drinking in remote communities already confirm the social ills.\n\n“The sad reality is people spend beyond their means in the hope that they’re going to become big winners and there are so many devastating stories of the harm it’s done to families and especially children.”\n\nThe Government’s take from poker machines was more than $60 million in the Territory last year.\n\n","byline":"By CHRISTOPHER WALSH ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/themercury.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/NT Business News/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/northern-territory/","/section/themercury.com.au/news/","/section/ntnews.com.au/business/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"ntnews.com.au","dateLive":"2014-06-27T07:42:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-28T05:45:53.000Z","description":"A GOVERNMENT plan to introduce pokies and liquor licences in remote communities to drum up cash are irresponsible and will have dire consequences, says the Labor Party.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xx-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xv-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnn3gfdo-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.themercury.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xy-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"themercury.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/business/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk2tq5v-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"ntnews.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5y0-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xz-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xw-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","themercury.com.au","ntnews.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"733a073ac65ed627eed174bcf36f1a80","keywords":["remote communities","social clubs","remote indigenous communities","people leaving communities","community responsibility","social impact assessment","sad reality","Northern Territory","Australia","Federal Government","Labor Party","Dave Tollner","Delia Lawrie","poker machines","machine revenue","fundamental rights","estimates hearings","dire consequences","community safety"],"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/clp-want-to-introduce-pokie-machines-to-remote-communities/story-fnk1w5xz-1226969910740?sv=99abf2035a476199276fab2640ed7d54","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226969910740","originalSource":"NTNews","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"790f973dba4b30081d65bbbec17bd486","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226969910712","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE CLP plan to introduce pokies and liquor licences in remote communities to drum up cash.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"CLP want to introduce pokie machines to remote communities","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"CLP gamble on remote communities","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"06e7f2fe-fe87-11e3-a5e6-68f29526d274 -

patterns.\n\nMy theories are based on my experiences of catching 890 sea barramundis by land based around our urban shores since 2010.\n\nOf course, you don’t have to agree with my thinking.\n\nBarramundi have a super wide-angle vision therefore they can attack baits by changing direction of their bodies sideways.\n\nA good sized barramundi is very cautious.\n\nBarramundi will follow a lure and remain neither too close nor too distant from it while they decide if they want to eat it. But he/she sometimes finally gives up following a lure.\n\nI think that barramundi may be short sighted.\n\nThe lateral line is a system of sense organs found in aquatic vertebrates, mainly fish, used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water. (Wikipedia)\n\nBarramundi’s vision by itself probably is not brilliant but lateral line is a very, very good sensor to produce a very good reaction.\n\nI think that they can sense a danger to them and the movement of bait fish even in muddy water using their lateral lines.\n\nI think that barramundi can see more colours than snappers if the water is clear.\n\nBarramundi’s bait hunting patterns are based on these above factors and maximise the barra’s advantage.\n\nBarramundi try to catch popular and familiar bait to them at the time and place when it is easiest for them.\n\nThey are creatures of habit.\n\nCheck out Hiro’s blog: secretbarramundi.blogspot.com.au \n\n","byline":"by HIRO NAKAMURA ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/Lifestyle/Fishing/","/section/ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/fishing/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"ntnews.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T02:35:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T02:48:27.000Z","description":"I HAD work the whole time this week.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/fishing/i-can-see-clearly-now/story-fnkchy3h-1226973677990?sv=d64b9df5cbee1b79a1c65781a4daab3b","name":"ntnews.com.au"}],"domains":["ntnews.com.au"],"id":"a13a35a3e78a3d52fb219cadb78e0e34","keywords":["familiar bait","lateral lines","aquatic vertebrates","hunting patterns","healthy-sized barramundi","lateral line","bait hunting patterns","bait fish","sense organs"],"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/fishing/i-can-see-clearly-now/story-fnkchy3h-1226973677990?sv=d64b9df5cbee1b79a1c65781a4daab3b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973677990","originalSource":"NTNews","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/Lifestyle/Fishing/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"e0296738f5ed6a0a13f1404b9d82d451","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973677128","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A REVEALING look at the barramundi’s field of vision and hunting patterns.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"I can see clearly now","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"I can see clearly now","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"d91cd9c2-00c8-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["saltwater barramundi","premium supplier","barramundi","premium"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/ntnews/images/1226973677041?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973677041","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226973675248","subtitle":"d91cd9c2-00c8-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d","title":"I can see clearly now","width":100},"title":"I can see clearly now"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"People who knew Scott Allen Millar had feared he might have tried to return.\n\nVictorian police were searching for Millar, 42, after the naked and battered body of a woman aged about 30 was found in Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens on Sunday morning.\n\nIt is believed the Chinese hospitality worker was walking to work early on Saturday when she was chased and then allegedly sexually and physically assaulted.\n\nJoggers found her body later that morning.\n\nREAD: FAMILY TRAGEDY RULED MURDER-SUICIDE \n\nMillar was arrested in NSW yesterday afternoon following the release of security film.\n\nA Darwin resident, who refused to be named for safety reasons, told the NT News: “He was in Darwin eight weeks ago.

He was very genuine. And on the golf course he definitely had a great rapport with our social group.\n\n“Such a passionate and likable man who assimilated into the Darwin community with great respect.\n\n“Graham’s witty sense of humour and wayward golf shots will be happy memories.”\n\nMr Kemp was National Heart Foundation Northern Territory board vice-president from 2008 to 2014.\n\nBoard president Marcus Ilton said Mr Kemp was known for his wit as well as his work as a spokesman for the construction industry.\n\n“He was very easy to work with. He made a great contribution to the board and was ­always helping the CEO and the national group as well.\n\n“He was a major contributor to the Darwin community and to the Northern Territory community.”\n\nIn 2005 when the NT News asked Mr Kemp for his New Year’s resolution, it was in the same vein.\n\n“To be able to hit a golf ball straight for 250m,” he said. “No that’s not a resolution – that’s a dream!’’\n\nColliers International Darwin principal Chris Hyland said Mr Kemp was well liked, respected and a tireless worker for the construction industry.\n\nChief Minister Adam Giles remembered a man who was “ deeply committed to making the Territory a better place”.\n\nBorn in Adelaide, Mr Kemp moved to Darwin in 1999 after working in the Housing Industry Association SA/NT branch in Adelaide. He came to Darwin to be the first manager of the new NT branch.\n\nMr Kemp joined the Board of Australia Day Council NT in 2006 and served for six years. He spent most of that time as the deputy chair.\n\nDarwin Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim was the former executive director of the Australia Day Council NT and said Mr Kemp was a selfless volunteer.\n\n“He was a wonderful man,” she said.\n\n“He was caring he gave up lot to the community and was an outstanding committee member.”\n\nMr Kemp was the loving husband of Daniela (deceased) and Christine, as well as the ­father of Matthew and Andrew and father-in-law of Leah and Kerry.\n\nHe was also the stepfather of Sean, Justin and Danielle.\n\n","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News and

will end up getting burnt once all proposed stock is built and they can’t find a tenant prepared to pay a decent rent.\n\nMr Ryder has produced a list of the top 10 markets to avoid and five markets to treat with caution – among which Darwin CBD was listed.\n\nHalf of the markets he advises against investing in are located in Queensland.\n\nREAD: PRICES DROP FOR FIRST TIME IN A YEAR \n\nMr Ryder said the two current “danger situations’’ in the market are inner-city apartment markets and regional centres, where a rise in supply coincided with a drop in demand, as is the case in many mining areas.\n\nIn Darwin alone, there are 2038 existing units. A Census from 2011 reveals 409 units were completed in the past three years.\n\nThere are an additional 2242 units under way – 224 of those units are newly constructed, 745 under construction and 1273 have passed the first stage of obtaining a development application approval.\n\nReal Estate Central director of projects Daniel Harris has dismissed Mr Ryder’s warnings, saying his predictions are a few years premature.\n\nREAD: CLP ANNOUNCES TWO NEW SUBURBS \n\n“In our projects office, we have actually found 2014 to be more buoyant than 2013,” Mr Harris said. “The Top End has some of the most severe existing housing shortfalls in the country – just ask anyone who’s searching for a rental property this time of year.”\n\nHe expects supply will catch up with demand eventually, but doesn’t see this happening any time soon.\n\n“At our projects office, we deal with investors from all over the country and Darwin remains the preferred choice for Aussie investors chasing ‘yields’ and increasing the cashflow within their portfolio,” Mr Harris said. “They get the benefits of investing in a mining town with the stability offered by a capital city.”\n\nWhether it happens sooner or later, Mr Ryder believes Darwin, along with Sydney and Canberra, is heading in the direction of having major surpluses of inner-city apartments, just like Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth do already.\n\n","byline":"By DANI McDONALD ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News

frequently deal with violent addicts.\n\nDetective Superintendent Peter Schiller, who runs the drug and organised crime squad, said the ice plague in the Top End began in about 2005.\n\n“It’s like they’re taking zombie tablets,” Supt Schiller said.\n\n“The people who use it have ­violent turns of behaviour, they’re irrational and the ­energy displayed is very ­destructive.\n\n“You might hear about someone being beaten up on the street but you can guarantee the most damage is done inside the home.\n\n“They steal from family but it’s the behaviour that is the real concern – a heroin addict will steal your telly but he won’t usually beat you up.”\n\nREAD: FOUR ARRESTED AFTER METH BUSGT \n\nAustralian Medical Association NT president Dr Robert Parker said the drug is also affecting health workers who have to deal with users who frequently wind up in hospital.\n\n“They often have psychotic episodes and require ongoing management,” Dr Parker said.\n\n“These people are very sick and need a high level of ­observation.\n\n“The level of aggressiveness and lack of insight means they are dangerous to themselves and to others.”\n\nThe drug sells for about $2000 a gram. Recently there have been a swag of high-profile cases, including involving outlaw motorcycle gangs, related to the drug. A Hells ­Angels bikie was busted this week with an alleged $250,000 worth of ice.\n\nIt seems to have found its way to the centre as well.\n\nAlice Springs youth advocate Matty Day warned this week about a possible methamphetamine spike among young people in town, citing a recent string of break-ins.\n\nREAD: METH AND ECSTASY LAND MAN IN JAIL \n\nFamilies and users have also spoken out about the horrific impacts of the drug.\n\nOne woman told the NT News she knew of three people in Darwin who have become addicted in recent months.\n\n“I’m talking successful people, with families, partners, kids, a house – the lot. They now stand to lose everything they’ve worked so hard for. It all means nothing once someone is addicted to ice,” she said.\n\n“There is a serious ice epidemic in Darwin. Ice is in a league of its own.”\n\nHealth Minister Robyn Lambley said the department was “very conscious of the significant risks involved in the use of such dangerous recreational substances, both to the users and also to others in the community”.\n\n“As the result of recent episodes, the Chief Health officer, spoke publicly and strongly of the several associated risks.”\n\n","byline":"By ELLIE TURNER and KYLIE STEVENSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/themercury.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/ntnews.com.au/NT News/Top News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/themercury.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/northern-territory/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/","/section/ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"ntnews.com.au","dateLive":"2014-06-28T00:52:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-28T00:53:34.000Z","description":"SOUTHERN bikies and dealers are targeting cashed-up drug users in Darwin, bringing with them a river of methamphetamines that have created an “epidemic” on our streets.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5xx-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5xv-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.themercury.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5xy-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"themercury.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnn3gfdo-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk0b1zt-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"ntnews.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5y0-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5xz-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnk1w5xw-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","themercury.com.au","news.com.au","ntnews.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"602e25b2ea6b147e98f583e5a0819561","keywords":["ice plague","ice epidemic","possible methamphetamine","causing havoc","health workers","SOUTHERN bikies","ongoing management","dangerous recreational substances","youth advocate","organised crime squad","outlaw motorcycle gangs","heroin addict","violent addicts","cashed-up drug users","real concern","high-profile cases","horrific impacts","zombie tablets","insight means","Alice Springs","Northern Territory","Australia","Peter Schiller","Matty Day"],"link":"http://www.ntnews.com.au/national/northern-territory/terrifying-ice-age-grips-nt/story-fnn3gfdo-1226969777480?sv=2cf7c0b8b2f0ae0bafaab4ee34c49ab6","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226969777480","originalSource":"NTNews","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/NT News/NT News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"a7ccdf20c5fb8c807efb8268723ecd55","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226969773452","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A RIVER of methamphetamines brought in to Darwin by bikies and dealers have created an “epidemic” on our streets.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Terrifying ice age grips NT","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Michael Franchi"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Terrifying ice age grips NT","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"3254ebce-fdc7-11e3-8184-7d8b4f4697c9 -

He might well have been saying “g’day Rafa’’.\n\nAfter three hours on the court and more than 37 aces later, having firmly established himself as The Next Big Thing with a shock defeat of the world number one he was saying “Cheerio Rafa’’ with a “juicy wiggle’’ dance celebration.\n\nThe scoreline was an incredible 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 for Kyrgios to set up a quarter-final clash against Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\nFIRSTS: Nick v Nadal by numbers\n\nFAMILY: How mum’s negativity fired up Nick\n\nPRIDE: Kyrgios kicks off Twitter storm with humble post\n\nSo emphatic was the performance, tennis legend John McEnroe remarked: “He’s acting to me like he can win the whole tournament. The last guy that I saw like that was Boris Becker.”\n\nKyrgios turned to his dad George wearing his akubra hat smiling broadly and his sister Halimah in tears in the players’ box and pumped his fist and danced on court to celebrate amid wild roars from the crowd.\n\n“I think I was in a bit of a zone, I didn’t notice the crowd, it hasn’t sunk in,’’ he said, noting modestly, “I played some extraordinary tennis, I was struggling a bit on return, but I got a break in fourth.’’\n\nKyrgios stated the obvious remarking: “I served at a really good level all the way through the match.’’\n\nKyrgios said he had seen an interview given by his mum Norlaila back in Canberra where she had remarked Nadal would be too good for her boy.\n\n“That made me angry, so I don’t know what she is thinking’’, he said smiling. Later when asked what he would say to his mum, he said he would send her a smiley text.\n\nFor the first time since 1982 someone from outside the world 100 had beaten a world number one.\n\nKyrgios started the big game with a ferocity that belied his 19 years, his wildcard status and his inexperience in the senior game. The crowd that filled centre court was initially unsure about this gangly Aussie upstart. How would he handle this pressure cooker atmosphere? As it turned out, the tougher and more critical the point, the more Kyrgios pulled out a blistering serve, a crosscourt backhand winner, or a line-hugging return. Midway during the second set Kyrgios pulled off an instinctive between the legs shot, that ended up being a winner.\n\nKyrgios said: “I think on the big stage, it’s something I thrive on, the atmosphere, the crowd. I just love it when at 5-3, I think it was in the fourth set, they erupted, the crowd. I just love that feeling. At that stage you just think about all the work you put in. You know if you believe in yourself. Especially with my serve, if I just go after it, hit the right spots, I’m going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match like that today.’’\n\nFrom the start he had shocked Nadal and won over the polite crowd. “Aussie’’ yelled one British clipped accent in simple acknowledgment he was witnessing the rapid emergence of a genuine world class contender.\n\nWith his lackadaisical and relaxed manner — clearly undaunted by reputation of the man on the other side of the net — Kyrgios had quickly notched two game points and three set points in the first set. The speed of his play unsettled Nadal who likes his precise routine between points. But the sheer power generated by the 19-year-old saw him bring up an astounding victory.\n\n“Nadal’s wishing Gasquet had put him away a couple of rounds ago, right now,’’ said McEnroe mid-match.\n\nNadal said he had created opportunities but wasn’t able to counter Kyrgios’ big serve. And as he started, Kyrgios closed the epic encounter with another ace.\n\n“Congratulations to him. For me, the beach,’’ said Nadal.\n\nKyrgios will now look to the quarter-finals for his match up against the huge serving Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\n“Have to do it all again tomorrow and I can’t wait! First @Wimbledon & I’m in the last 8 club!!’’, he tweeted later.\n\nHaving played Raonic at Roland Garros last month, Kyrgios, still buzzing from his sensational victory over the world number one Rafael Nadal, was asked about what he could expect when they play in the early hours of tomorrow morning.\n\n“There’s going to be a lot of walking from side to side from his serve, and there’s going to be a lot of winners in the match,\" he said smiling.\n\nRaonic is credited with the biggest serve in the game. At just 23 he is the youngest in the world top ten. But with Kyrgios also regularly firing down serves in excess of 130mph the match will be a peppered-fest of powered aces.\n\n\"It’s going to be hard to find rhythm,\" said Kyrgios. I’m just going to go out there and just go my return of serve. Holding serve is going to be important, being able to make inroads on the other person’s serves.\"\n\nHe admits to being scared of the more illustrious names he is now encountering. Raonic beat him in the first round of the French Open in straight sets.\n\n\"Definitely I’m scared, but I just go through my routine and I just play aggressive,\" he said of his strategy.\n\n\"You know, if they play too good on that point, then it’s too good.\n\n\"But I’m going to go after it and give myself the best chance to win the point.\"\n\nRaonic, who like Kyrgios has been notching up in excess of 30 aces a match said his serve gives him a bit of freedom on the return.\n\nThe winner of the match will probably face the in-form Swiss legend Roger Federer in the semifinals.\n\n","byline":"Jacquelin Magnay in London ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T19:53:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T00:04:35.000Z","description":"AND it started with an ace.

Kyrgios raised his arms and circled for the crowd, as if to say “you’re welcome”.\n\nNadal, in no mood to admire, turned his back almost immediately. The shot has drawn comparisons with Roger Federer’s famous “tweener” at the 2009 US Open, considered by some as the greatest shot of all time.\n\nIn the context of the match, Kyrgios’ winner meant little.\n\nHe was 40-0 down at the time and went on to lose the game and the set.\n\nHowever it was a perfect illustration of the fearless attitude that helped him pull off one of the biggest upsets in grand slam history.\n\nIt was one of a stack of spectacular winners for Kyrgios, who says his aggressive shot-making is more than a case of youthful exuberance.\n\n“I love to entertain,” Kyrgios said.\n\n“I think I’m always going to have a style of game that’s aggressive.\n\n“To be able to play my best tennis, that’s how I’m going to have to play. I am going to have to play free, back myself under pressure.\n\n“That’s going to give me the best chance to win matches.”\n\nThe teenage sensation said it was getting angry at his mum thinking he couldn’t beat the world number one that inspired his shock victory.\n\nThe 19-year-old, ranked 144 in the world, said he got all fired up by his Malaysian mother Norlaila thinking he had no chance against the two-time Wimbledon champion.\n\n“I was reading a comment that she thought Rafa was too good for me. It actually made me a bit angry. You would think he’s in a whole other level compared to me. I just believed in myself that I could create some opportunities,’’ the Australian said.\n\nKyrgios, making his Wimbledon debut on a wildcard, downed 14-time Grand Slam winner Nadal 7-6 (7/5), 5-7, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in an astonishing fourth round upset.\n\n\"I’m pretty happy. That’s the biggest win of my career, and that’s something I’m never going to forget. I’m going to draw so much confidence out of that no matter where I play now. To have that under my belt, it’s massive,’’ he said.\n\nThe wildcard performed a victory jig on the Centre Court, a dance move he called the \"juicy wiggle’’.\n\nThe teenager did not have time to speak to his mum on the telephone but said: \"I’ll just text her a smiley face.’’\n\n\"I’ve no girlfriend. My family have rotated from home. I get homesick pretty quickly if I don’t see them. I have my sister and my dad here at the moment. I think they’ve been good enough to come, visit me, make sure I’m okay.’’\n\nKyrgios next faces the huge-serving Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic on Court One on Wednesday for a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\"I’m just a normal kid, 19-year-old. I play a lot of Xbox. I brought my Xbox with me. Never did I think a week ago I was going to make the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in my first appearance,’’ he said.\n\nKyrgios said appearing on the giant show courts did not faze him one bit.\n\n\"On the big stage, it’s something I thrive on: the atmosphere, the crowd. I just love it when at 5-3, I think it was in the fourth set, they erupted, the crowd. I just love that feeling,’’ he said.\n\n\"At that stage you just think about all the work you put in. You know if you believe in yourself. Especially with my serve, if I just go after it, hit the right spots, I’m going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match.’’\n\nThree-time 1980s Wimbledon champion John McEnroe, himself a feisty youth in his heyday, reckons Kyrgios can win the whole tournament, but the Australian is trying not to get ahead of himself.\n\n\"I’m just going to stay grounded,’’ he said.\n\n\"Milos has probably got the best serve in the world. I’m just going to go out there and have fun again.\n\n\"I’m always going to have a style of game that’s aggressive, having an aggressive serve, really take control from the baseline. To be able to play my best tennis, that’s how I’m going to have to play.\n\n\"I am going to have to play free, back myself under pressure. That’s going to give me the best chance to win matches.\n\n\"There’s going to be a lot of walking from side to side from his serve, and there’s going to be a lot of winners in the match. It’s going to be hard to find rhythm.

It was widely viewed as the crowning achievement of a long and illustrious career.\n\nThe Queen had given Harris a CBE in 2006, a year after the ­entertainer had painted her portrait as a special 80th birthday gift to the nation.\n\nWhat the monarch didn’t know was that her protection staff had been warned at the time she sat for the portrait that Harris was ­accused of assaulting a young girl.\n\n“He ruined my life,’’ the letter warned. “You need to know what kind of man you’ve let near the Queen.’’\n\nEven if she had been aware, however, the Queen, like all Britons, would likely have discounted the claims as sheer nonsense, such was the exalted, irreproachable reputation of cuddly, quirky Harris. That reputation now counts for nought. Harris will forever more be remembered as a serial abuser and chronic liar who has wrecked countless lives.\n\nAfter several days of deliberation, the jury of six women and six men on Monday decided that Harris, now 84, and a much diminished version of that ebullient favoured performer of royalty, was indeed a sinister pervert who had a demon lurking beneath the charming exterior. The jury had discovered that each stroke of evidence, even bits that were vague or unclear, could be pieced together to identify what was happening, just like one of Harris’ showman lines: “Can you guess what it is yet?’’\n\nIndeed, as woman after woman told of their abuse at the hands of Harris, the extent of his predatory behaviour became clear.\n\nTellingly, Harris had close links to Britain’s most prolific pedophile Jimmy Savile. It can now be reported that Harris and Savile, who were colleagues and two of the BBC’s most visible celebrities, embarked on an out-of-hours evening visit to the high-security Broadmoor psychiatric hospital in 1973. Savile, who had his own keys to the establishment, took Harris to the punishment ward at precisely the time the patients were stripped naked before going to bed. One patient recalled Harris performing an impromptu Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport during his visit.\n\nHarris may have believed that his arrogant molestation of young girls was adequately masked behind his genial, bear-hug persona and he was safe from discovery throughout the decades. Perhaps he was emboldened because his sudden predatory actions so shocked his victims — more so with people nearby, and with his insouciant attitude afterwards — no one would believe them.\n\nBut Harris’s downfall came about because all of his victims before the court had told a confidant: either a school friend, medical staffer, doctor, husband, brother, father or counsellor many years earlier about their ugly encounters with the “dirty old man Rolf ­Harris’’, “the kiddie fiddler’’, the “octopus’’. As innocuous as some remarks may have been at the time, this very contemporaneous outpouring about assaults in confidence to others, many decades before it was to be significant, helped nail Harris. It was a tactic the police and prosecution were keenly conscious of — and other complaints that did not have this back-up evidence were put to one side.\n\nNone of this would have come to light if not for Harris’s performance at the royal Diamond Jubilee Concert in London on that June 2012 evening.\n\nNearly 180km to the north of the capital, a 47-year-old woman watching that event at a family party suddenly erupted in a flood of tears when Harris appeared. This tearful, middle-aged woman finally felt strong enough, following years of alcoholic rehabilitation, to complain to Scotland Yard, some eight years after first detailing the abuse to doctors.\n\nThe catalyst was simple: she couldn’t bear seeing Harris any more on the television. “I thought I can’t get away from this bloody man,’’ she said. Without her initiative, it is unlikely Harris would have had his day in court.\n\nAt the time, Harris was enjoying the fruits of half a century of adoration in his adopted country, presenting a television show Animal Hospital, receiving another award from the Queen — an Order of Australia — and arriving at Australia House in The Strand for a reception in ugg boots.\n\nThe timing of the complaint by the woman, who can’t be named for legal reasons but was identified in court as the childhood friend of Bindi, Harris’s daughter, was particularly critical. Two months earlier, in October 2012, Operation Yewtree had been established to investigate historic sex claims, following the unmasking of Savile.\n\nSavile had a sleazy, uncomfortable demeanour but had escaped investigation, despite isolated complaints throughout the decades, because of his celebrity status, and disjointed policing in different boroughs.\n\nOperation Yewtree also investigated a hotline of complaints against a celebrity roll call: Stuart Hall, Max Clifford, Bill Roache, David Lee Travis and Gary Glitter, with mixed results.\n\nHarris was so fearful when he went to see Scotland Yard nine days after the woman had given nearly three hours of evidence, he refused to answer any questions on the advice of his solicitor.\n\nInstead Harris composed a statement, which the police received several days later, explaining he knew the woman, and they had had consensual sexual activity on two occasions. He later admitted he had not revealed another half a dozen sex acts because he was embarrassed revealing such details in front of “two lovely ladies’’ in the solicitors’ office.\n\nBut Bindi’s childhood friend had told a variety of people in 1996 about Harris and it was never in terms of a consensual relationship, but rather child abuse from the age of 13 starting on a Harris holiday to Hawaii and Australia. Her parents, brothers and four different medical personnel, and critically Bindi herself and Bindi’s then boyfriend Malcolm Cox were all informed with immediate consequences. Cox didn’t want Harris anywhere near his and Bindi’s baby son, and their relationship folded.\n\nSuch was Bindi’s distress at the discovery of this abuse, she tried to stab herself with forks and furiously confronted her father. His response? “I’m sorry, love.’’\n\nPolice continued their investigations and Harris continued to stonewall, hoping it would all go away. So secretive was he about the trouble, his brother and manager Bruce wouldn’t find out until watching one of the complainants, Tonya Lee, on A Current Affair 18 months later.\n\nThree months after this first questioning under caution, police had obtained from the woman’s mother the infamous letter in which Harris revealed his self-loathing and said he was sickened by what he had done to her.\n\nOn March 24 last year he was called to the police station again. As was his right, he refused any questions, but submitted in writing a statement revealing he had had sex with the woman three or four times. This time the rumours were in overload and The Sun splashed on its front page in the middle of April last year that it was Harris — the children’s entertainer and much loved public figure — who was being questioned about sex allegations.\n\nThe public response was immediate. In New Zealand a woman who had been assaulted by Harris on the dance floor when she was 16 said to her husband “they finally got the bastard”. Over the next few months more and more women got in touch with Scotland Yard, including six whose accounts were vital in providing further bad character evidence against Harris. A further five were not allowed in evidence by the judge. None of them knew the other, yet their interactions with Harris were all tawdry and despite the passage of decades, they were still emotionally affected by the incidents.\n\nA woman in Malta described how she had been “happy’’ that Harris had finished intimately molesting her because she had feared he was planning to rape her.\n\nThere was the makeup lady from Channel Seven who was consistently groped; the Darwin woman who had been given her first tongue-kiss by Harris; Australian actor Tony Porter who witnessed Harris fondling another makeup woman; and a mother and daughter in Hamilton, near Newcastle, who were assaulted during a British Paints promotion.\n\nLast night, Lee, who was assaulted by Harris when she was a 14-year-old on a trip to London with a theatre group and is the only victim of Harris who has waived her right to anonymity, told A Current Affair the entertainer had ruined her life.\n\n“Everyone thought that Rolf was just this great person,” she said. “He wasn’t. He was a pedophile. I hate that he’s ruined my life and he doesn’t even acknowledge it. He doesn’t even remember me — that’s what he told the court. Can you believe that?”\n\nIn the midst of his legal nightmare last year, Harris ran on stage at the Bristol Hippodrome, still the quirky entertainer singing Court of King Caractacus, Jake The Peg, his famous covers of Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven, Delilah by Tom Jones and a rousing Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport — to the memorable tune of Land of Hope and Glory.\n\nHarris’s humiliation and the public downfall of his private life have now stained his much-loved public performances. No longer the much-loved children’s entertainer, Harris is now the convicted pedophile who had preyed upon unsuspecting young girls.\n\nFrom a televised blue-blood engagement such a short time ago, the final memory of Harris is a few bars of Jake The Peg, sung in desperation under the stark fluorescent lights of a dingy 1970s courtroom in Southwark, just metres from the Tower of London and in front of a bewildered jury.\n\n","byline":"Jacquelin Magnay ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The

The couple have been each other’s alibis almost from the start, insisting they spent the night together at his house.\n\nThe 30-year-old Sollecito said he had “always believed, and still believes, that Amanda Marie Knox is innocent”.\n\nBut he said the guilty verdict handed down by an appeal court in Florence this year was based on details which exonerate him. “The 25-year prison sentence given to me is based entirely on the statement written by Amanda Knox in pre-trial detention. She herself exonerates me entirely,” he told a press conference in Rome.\n\nIn the text, the US citizen described “flashes of blurred images” in which she saw herself in the house while the murder was being committed, “with my hands over my ears because in my head I could hear Meredith screaming”.\n\nShe makes no mention of Sollecito, which his defence invokes as proof he was not present at the scene.\n\nKnox later recanted this version of events, saying she had written it under police pressure.\n\nSollecito’s lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said their appeal would also revolve around a text message which Knox claims to have sent while with Sollecito at his house the night of the murder.\n\n“This text message, according to the court’s own ruling, was not sent from his house. Therefore the pair were not together,” she said.\n\nSollecito is relying on the log from his home computer to prove he was home at the time of the killing.\n\nWhile the Italian always claimed Knox “spent the night” with him, he never said they spent the evening together - which is when the crime took place, Bongiorno said.\n\nKnox and Sollecito - originally sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison for the murder - were acquitted on appeal in 2011 after four years behind bars, but then found guilty again by a Florence court in January.\n\nThe trial will next year go back to Italy’s highest court, which could uphold the verdict or order a retrial.

The evidence has been plentiful for some years and continues to mount. The origins of the crisis are deep-seated. This is the reason it is unlikely to be easily reversed. The nation’s economic advantages are extensive but unless buttressed by effective public policy they will erode relentlessly.\n\nThe troubles of the Rudd-Gillard era, usually attributed to their fierce leadership rivalry, can only be grasped in the context of the malaise within the political system. The omens suggest this might only deepen under the Abbott prime ministership.\n\nThe erosion in Australia’s political culture over a decade is alarming. It is tied to wider social and media trends. That many Western democracies are at a more advanced stage of this malaise — defined as the inability of political systems to respond to the needs of their societies — is no cause for assurance.\n\nIndeed, the global evidence only raises a troubling question: is this the new norm? The former Labor government was broken by the pressures of the system. Labor under both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, despite their achievements, was not able to hold the line on sustainable policy delivery.\n\nThe institutional question arising from Tony Abbott’s policies is whether a reforming prime minister can succeed any more in this country given the decisive shift in the system and culture against reform. The last three prime ministers were destroyed over management of their reform agendas: John Howard on Work Choices, Rudd and Gillard on a mix of climate change, mining tax and fiscal policy.\n\nIt is true these leaders made serious mistakes. It is equally true they faced a transformed political environment that made reform much tougher. The historical record of the Hawke-Keating era is rightly lauded. But it is by no means clear that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating would succeed in today’s system.\n\nAny nation that has lost the art of collective self-improvement has stepped on to the escalator of decline. Australia is on that escalator. Its politics are so noisy, egotistical, destructive and consumed by self-interest that it has missed where the escalator is heading.\n\nIn voting terms it is far harder than before to construct and hold together a majority for reform. ­Laments about the decline of bipartisanship are ancient history. Bipartisanship faded away in the early Howard years, think 1996-97.\n\nBut the Liberal-Labor gulf over the nation’s direction has widened recently and now involves division over climate change, budget policy, industrial relations, tax reform, welfare entitlements, pensions, Medicare, university fees, competition and productivity. Agreement over the national direction is being torn apart.\n\nThe incentives in the system reward and promote policy division. Such splits are not just ideological; they are tactical. Australia is dominated by a poll-driven political culture. It privileges sectional interests over the national interest, short-term actions and the power of the negative.\n\nRecent history is defined by the triumph of the negative and fatal blunders on the part of agents for changes, witness the ACTU campaign against Work Choices, the mining industry campaign against the mining tax, the Abbott-led destruction of carbon pricing and, most recently, the undermining of the Abbott-Hockey budget on the crusade of fairness.\n\nLabor, convinced it was destroyed in office by Abbott’s unjustified negativity and unable to accept it was undone primarily by its own blunders, now exploits a tough and unpopular budget to inflict the same treatment on Abbott.\n\nIt is no surprise that 22 years of unbroken economic growth have exerted a profound impact on our political culture. Its corruption is advanced though how far is yet to be tested. It is defined by two qualities: complacency and expectations that cannot be financed by the tax base.\n\nIndeed, legislated programs cannot be financed by the tax base as the current and former Treasury secretaries have warned. Yet much of the political system insists Australia has no budgetary problem. It says the harsh medicine being handed out is unnecessary because the problem has been fabricated. This reveals an immaturity in public debate the nation was supposed to have left behind decades ago.\n\nThere are many manifestations: a culture of complaint, the decline of self-reliance, the belief that virtually any hardship is the fault of government and a political system that bids for votes by promising that government will solve even more problems.\n\nThe irony of modern government is apparent: it cannot deliver the product on time as promised, making people even more unhappy. The state is overloaded. This was basic in undermining Rudd where the gulf between his promises and delivery became a huge liability.\n\nThe prosperity generated by the decade-long China boom has seen a decline in public interest policy, the rise of a more self-interested culture and a retreat in informed opinion about the reasons for Australia’s past success and the need for another round of national interest reform.\n\nThe trust between the political system and the people to sustain ambitious policy may now be severed. If so, Australia faces an unhappy deterioration from its recent highs.\n\nFragmentation is the story of the times. Labor has lost a large segment of voters to the Greens. Abbott faces the prospect of being undermined by Clive Palmer, Australia’s version of a populist Berlusconi. Disillusionment in the community may be matched by deadlock in the parliament.\n\nThe fragmentation of the media marketplace fits into this process. Technology and campaign techniques mean disaffected voters from any government or opposition policy can be targeted and won.\n\nCreating losers is more high risk than before. The decline of mass media and rise of social media weakens the ability of leaders to carry opinion and shifts media power downwards.\n\nDuring the reform age, roughly 1983 to 2003, the media was pivotal in backing national interest policies but that age is passing. It is replaced by new media values that mirror the fashionable narcissism and find national interest debates as quaint and irrelevant.\n\nAustralia’s prosperity is living on borrowed time, courtesy of past reforms and the China boom. There is a silly, contested debate about whether Australia faces an economic crisis. There is no doubt, however, that Australia is undergoing a crisis of its political system.\n\n","byline":"PAUL KELLY ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/Paul Kelly/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Opinion/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/opinion/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T13:33:43.000Z","description":"THE trajectory of Australia’s relative decline now seems set with the nation in denial of its economic challenges and suffering a malaise in its political decision-making — signalling that a country that cannot recognise its problems is far from finding their solution.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/politics-in-crisis-and-a-nation-in-denial/story-e6frg74x-1226974255262?sv=a235dfc984f88a5cfbc5838e5ebdf203","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"38041bc9a0ade5e99ce201fb6f107447","keywords":["political system","national interest","national interest reform","political culture","national interest debates","climate change","sectional interests","PAUL KELLY","transformed political environment","national interest policies","interest policy","political decision-making","sustainable policy delivery","relative decline","national direction","poll-driven political culture","contested debate","industrial relations","fiscal policy","political systems","institutional question","historical record","opposition policy","self-interested culture","policy division","troubling question","carbon pricing","voting terms","unhappy deterioration","short-term actions","ambitious policy","public policy","prime ministership","economic challenges","mining tax","economic advantages","fatal blunders","welfare entitlements","fierce leadership rivalry","unjustified negativity","social media","China","Julia Gillard","Paul Keating","Kevin Rudd","Tony Abbott","Bob Hawke","Hawke-Keating"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/politics-in-crisis-and-a-nation-in-denial/story-e6frg74x-1226974255262?sv=a235dfc984f88a5cfbc5838e5ebdf203","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974255262","originalAssetId":"1226974255262","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/Paul Kelly/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","related":[],"standFirst":"OUR political culture is noisy, egotistical, destructive and consumed by self-interest.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE trajectory of Australia’s relative decline now seems set with the nation in denial of its economic challenges and suffering a malaise in its political decision-making — signalling that a country that cannot recognise its problems is far from finding their solution.\n\n","subtitle":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["kordinaj"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial\n","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"b92fc5b0-00fb-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Paul Kelly"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226974256214?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974256214","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974256188","subtitle":"b92fc5b0-00fb-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d","title":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial\n","width":100},"title":"Politics in crisis, nation in denial"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":["Paige Taylor"],"body":"A senior Sri Lankan navy official said a naval vessel departed yesterday following several days of talks with Australian authorities about how to handle the impending asylum-seeker arrivals — which would have been the first to reach Australian territory in six months. “What I know is that one of our ships has already sailed.

There are two separate incidents,” Commodore Kosila told The Australian.\n\n“We have been informed by the Australian Border Protection Services that they have rescued Sri Lankan asylum-seekers.\n\n“Now they say they are bringing them on board this border protection ship and they will be handed over to the Sri Lankan navy.

There was speculation it had been intercepted by an Australian Customs vessel.\n\nGreens leader Christine Milne demanded Tony Abbott reveal their fate.\n\n“Where are the people?” the Greens leader said in Sydney. “In the 21st century it is unacceptable that people can just disappear, we have to know what is going on and the Prime Minister must tell us.”\n\nA spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison again declined to comment, saying only that the government would act “in accordance” with international obligations and protect the safety of life at sea.\n\n“In accordance with the policy established by the Operation Sovereign Borders Joint Agency Task Force commander, the government does not comment on speculation or reporting regarding on water operations,” the spokesman said.\n\nThe Sri Lankan navy’s confirmation of its involvement is the first indication that Australian authorities both knew of at least one vessel and have been negotiating for its return.\n\nSeveral mid-ocean transfers of asylum-seekers between Australian and Indonesian authorities have occurred in recent months.

I can’t say what my final position will be,” he said.\n\nThe Australian was told yesterday that Victorian Senator Ricky Muir, from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, also has concerns about the Newstart changes.\n\n“We’re still to be briefed on the government’s policies so it’s not possible to give definitive answers on what he will support,” said Senator Muir’s adviser Glenn Druery.\n\n“But he has expressed concerns about the issue privately.”\n\nMr Abbott told his cabinet colleagues yesterday that he was “reasonably optimistic” of getting a good outcome with the new Senate.\n\n“I think we can all be very confident that the deal that we struck with the Australian people in the election campaign is being delivered upon so, well done,” he told them.\n\nThe Newstart change is one of the key reforms in social services bills that outline more than $12bn in savings over four years — most of them to be stymied or vetoed by Labor, the Greens and those on the crossbench.\n\nThe reform is due to start in January and will require those aged under 30 to wait up to six months before they receive Newstart, although the waiting period is shorter for those with many years of work behind them.\n\nThose who go back to school or start vocational education will avoid the six-month waiting period.\n\nGreens families spokeswoman Rachel Siewert said the idea was a “cruel policy” to impose severe hardship on some of the 550,000 applications for emergency relief forecast over the next four years.\n\nIntensifying the debate over youth unemployment, the Abbott government began its Work for the Dole scheme yesterday in 18 trial sites around Australia to prepare for a national rollout from July next year.\n\nSenator Day also expressed concern at the idea of forcing young Australians to work for nothing,\n\n“No-one’s going in to bat for the jobless youth. We’re destroying a generation,” he said, arguing that young workers should be given the right to waive the workplace laws if it got them a job.\n\n“All you have to do is allow people to opt-out of if they want to,” he said.\n\n“If you don’t want to, you shouldn’t be forced to stay in the system and therefore stay unemployed.”\n\nSenator Day said he had no qualms about blocking the $1.2bn saving on the Newstart change in order to make the case for industrial relations reform. “There’s no contest — it’s a no-brainer,” he said.\n\n","byline":"DAVID CROWE ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T16:14:17.000Z","description":"A NEW fight is looming on the federal government’s welfare reforms as incoming Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits for the young, shooting down another key budget saving.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/new-senate-threat-to-federal-governments-welfare-reforms/story-fn59nsif-1226974431977?sv=a0e87e2762b9f4abf541550ea190986c","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"666ff4d5278ba41fde8d7ccf8c6b41f5","keywords":["welfare reforms","young people","penalty rates","workplace reform","social services","workplace laws","waiting period","conservative parties","key budget","unemployment benefits","federal government","emergency relief","key reforms","national rollout","start vocational education","definitive answers","expressed concerns","Australian people","jobless rules","budget agenda","unfair dismissal laws","Australia","Parliament House","Bob Day","David Leyon","industrial relations reform","incoming senators","tackle workplace reform","Greens families spokeswoman","workplace reforms","welfare plans","key budget saving","young workers","trial sites","final position","youth unemployment","government tackle","Liberal Party","Kevin Andrews","Tony Abbott","Glenn Druery","Ricky Muir","Rachel Siewert"],"kicker":"EXCLUSIVE","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/new-senate-threat-to-federal-governments-welfare-reforms/story-fn59nsif-1226974431977?sv=a0e87e2762b9f4abf541550ea190986c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974431977","originalAssetId":"1226974431977","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"74b92113e0ecd4ea430b0eb9ae6ffa0f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974426951","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"13dbc239139ca681d27e41218bce152e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974297422","referenceType":"SECONDARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A FIGHT is looming on the government’s welfare reforms as new Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"A NEW fight is looming on the federal government’s welfare reforms as incoming Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits for the young, shooting down another key budget saving. \n\nThe plan to force young Australians to “earn or learn” is heading for defeat as micro conservative parties demand the government tackle workplace reform rather than punish those who cannot find jobs.\n\n","subtitle":"New Senate threat to federal government’s welfare reforms","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Kym Smith"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"New Senate threat to welfare reforms","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"77a03fcc-00cd-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

The last guy that I saw like that was Boris Becker,” he told the BBC.\n\nAs fantastical the angles were that McEnroe created on a court and as shrill as his challenging of officials was, the American is not prone to hyperbole when rating talent, which makes the praise headier.\n\n“John McEnroe, who has a great understanding of the game and is an accurate assessment of talent, says he is the next big thing and that he hasn’t seen a kid like him in many, many years and he believes he could win the tournament,” Tiley said.\n\nOther Australian greats revelled in Kyrgios’ ability to retain composure against the formidable Nadal.\n\nJohn Newcombe was stunned that the 19-year-old, who faces Canadian Milos Raonic in a quarter-final tonight, was able to maintain his composure and concentration.\n\nParticularly impressive, Newcombe said, was that Kyrgios was able to stay with Nadal when the Spanish champion also served at an extremely high level.\n\nPaul McNamee described it as the day Australian tennis irrevocably changed.\n\nIt is all high praise for the Canberra teen who began his tennis career as a little ball boy, fetching after his older brother.\n\nTiley was renowned as a coach in South Africa and in the US College system before moving to Australia to take charge of our junior programs.\n\nHe has since been tasked with running the sport as a whole in Australia but his views are widely respected by stars including Nadal and Roger Federer, who called on Kyrgios as a practice partner leading into the French Open.\n\nTiley believes that Kyrgios is the type of player who will draw children to tennis.\n\n“He is fearless. He stands up to pressure. He has a good team around him of really good coaches and the entire Australian contingent,” he told SEN Radio.\n\n“He is someone that is exciting to watch. He has a big serve, a big game, he loves being out there and competes hard and we have just watched it here at Wimbledon. He walks around and has a natural attraction to all the young kids.\n\n“I think he is going to bring a lot of kids to our sport. I know we have the World Cup going on right now but there is far more exciting things, we think, in Australian sport watching our young players do well at Wimbledon.”\n\nKyrgios’ opponent also praised the young giant-slayer, but he hedged his bets as to whether he could he would become the next big star.\n\n“For me is very easy to say he can be top 10. I think he can do. Is not an issue that I think he cannot do it,’’ said Nadal. “But when we see a young player that arrives to the tour and plays a great match or plays a great tournament, people say he will be the next big star.\n\n“Some things are right — sometimes arrive, sometimes not. So depends how the things improve over the next couple of months, years, for him. So if he is able to keep improving, he will be. If not, will be more difficult.’’\n\n","byline":"Courtney Walsh ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T03:13:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:33:16.000Z","description":"IN the hours after Nick Kyrgios stunned Rafael Nadal, the ageing members of Australia’s golden generation of players were marvelling at the success of a young man destined for greater wins.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-likened-to-boris-becker-by-giants-of-tennis/story-fnbe6xeb-1226975092761?sv=5268eb332e697d9316fdfa8cc2f39623","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"b539c8c9c94d259f2b6a288da89ef336","keywords":["global headlines","news outlets","day Australian tennis","tennis career","Australian greats","Nick v","natural attraction","young giant-slayer","South Africa","London","United Kingdom","Australia","All England Club","John Mcenroe","Rafael Nadal","John Newcombe","Neale Fraser","Kenny Rosewall","Rod Laver","ball boy","Australian teenager","between-the-legs winner","practice partner","autobiography signing","things improve","commentary box","Australian contingent","Australian sport","United States of America College","British Broadcasting Corporation","Roger Federer","Craig Tiley","Boris Becker","Paul McNamee","Ken Rosewall","Courtney Walsh","Ashley Cooper","Fred Stolle"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-likened-to-boris-becker-by-giants-of-tennis/story-fnbe6xeb-1226975092761?sv=5268eb332e697d9316fdfa8cc2f39623","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975092761","originalAssetId":"1226975092761","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"c72c213c46693d2d11089ce0b6492edd","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"N0b2Jtbjpe0vna-e516tQ5Gm-Og_dac4","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"caadd2d5f052005c7907cc069f3e29a3","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"VwZzVtbjrTtJejX6X6tcl8QNrvZdFa27","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"63ec7fedd8c684ba6c3e1e95fc56b377","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975092735","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE_GALLERY","id":"8c7cdadf35f07d6bfb49205b353aeb6f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974962981","referenceType":"SECONDARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"4791fbcdabd589cd14d842cb8c24e277","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974722843","referenceType":"SECONDARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"3255e293809c8ad13ec7d3119820c689","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974527033","referenceType":"SECONDARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE giants of tennis, including John McEnroe, have said Nick Kyrgios is acting like he can win the tournament.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"IN the hours after Nick Kyrgios stunned Rafael Nadal, the ageing members of Australia’s golden generation of players were marvelling at the success of a young man destined for greater wins. \n\nKen Rosewall, considered one of the finest players never to win Wimbledon, has been at the All England Club for an autobiography signing.\n\n","subtitle":"Nick Kyrgios likened to Boris Becker by giants of tennis","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"ebcc194e-018a-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["aussie tennis palyer","brothers ball boy","brothers","tennis","palyer"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226975206212?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975206212","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226975206184","subtitle":"ebcc194e-018a-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac","title":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’","width":100},"title":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"While this may sound uncharitable, baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) and their cousins loudly resist any moves to crimp their lifestyle, content to leave it to future generations to pick up the tab. And pick it up they will. If the budget doesn’t pass, by the time today’s seven-year-olds get a vote they are likely to inherit nearly $700 billion in debt with a deficit of $25bn in today’s money, with no end in sight. That’s a far cry from no net debt and a 1 per cent gross domestic product surplus left to them at birth by the Howard government.\n\nWhen, in 2002, then treasurer Peter Costello released Australia’s first intergenerational report, we were given a clear insight into the challenges of an ageing population. He told us: “Australia is pretty much at the best point — the sweet spot — in the demographic transition, now.”\n\nHe predicted: “After 2010, the depen­dency ratio — the ratio between children and older people of working age — is expected to increase more rapidly as baby boomers reach pension age.”\n\nHow right he was. Since 2010, we have lost the equivalent of 200,000 mainly baby boomers, from the workforce. Another 250,000 are expected to retire between now and 2025. The impact of these retirements will be a growing headwind to future growth as it bears down on productivity. As Costello said: “Demography is destiny.” Armed with the intergenerational report, the Howard government set out to protect the interests of future generations by minimising the inevitable economic pressures it foresaw building beyond 2010.\n\nIt cleared the national debt and established the Future Fund to meet the growing pension claims of public servants. Contemporary taxpayers were required to contribute their share of future liabilities. Costello was looking 40 years into the future and beyond the forward estimates.\n\nThe Abbott government similarly is seized with the challenges posed by our demographics. Policies such as paid parental leave, the raising of the pensionable age to 70 for those under 50 and providing incentives for the employment of eligible workers over 50 are all directed at keeping as many people in the workforce as possible to boost productivity. In attempting to bring the budget into balance, the government is exercising a duty of care to future generations. But it is a lonely position.\n\nUnfortunately for the Abbott government, its policy options are limited. Gone is the budget surplus. Public debt stands at 30 per cent of GDP and is rising rapidly. Many of the Howard and Labor government concessions and supplements are no longer affordable.\n\nDemographic change is working against fiscal balance with escalating claims from an ageing population having to be met by a shrinking number of taxpayers in more uncertain economic times.\n\nInaction means government spending outstripping revenue when our terms of trade are falling and are expected to fall for another decade. Our labour and energy costs are among the world’s highest; productivity growth is weak and our global competitiveness is sliding.\n\nIt is clear that unless Australia takes stock of these developments, our fiscal situation must deteriorate further.\n\nYet there is collective opposition to attempts to remedy this, and a refusal to pay as you go. By definition it will fall to future generations to shoulder the burden. Where is the fairness in that?\n\nBy design or default, it is socially destructive to pit generations against each other. Take for example our 17 to 24-year-olds, 27 per cent of whom are not in full-time work or full-time study. Their poor education has left them exposed. Even those who seek part-time employment are likely to be denied because of unrealistic award structures. Inevitable feelings of alienation are what have led to the social unrest we have witnessed in Europe and Britain.\n\nIn his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Edmund Burke wrote that the real social contract is the partnership between the generations, “not only between those who are living but between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are to be born”.\n\nThe experience of the 17 to 24- year-olds suggests that contract is at risk. The young are outnumbered. Baby boomers already exceed the under-15s as a percentage of the population.\n\nEven assuming those voting for the first time would support fiscal balance — unlikely given the culture in which they have been raised — polls suggest they would be easily outvoted.\n\nSo, without urgent action, future generations seem destined to become critical of a system that allowed the profligacy and selfishness of previous generations to limit their opportunities.\n\nWith the present mix of macro and micro settings, our fiscal imbalances won’t fix themselves. We may pretend we’ll restore balance tomorrow when a “fairer” budget can be found, but realistically we know that day will never come because the longer we wait, the greater the sacrifices needed.\n\nAnd why not criticise the Coalition for being ham-fisted at selling the budget? It may be cynical but, if it derails the budget, as a political exercise it makes sense. The more the fiscal position deteriorates, the more the government will be blamed.\n\nWhile it may not be perfect, the Hockey budget is a sensible trade-off between recurrent spending and long-term investment and between structural balance and growth.\n\nIt is also the only budget on the table. Much is riding on it passing. Not least, a harmonious society and the future prosperity and social mobility of our young.\n\nNothing could be more equitable than that.\n\nMaurice Newman is chairman of the government’s Business Advisory Council. The views expressed here are his own.\n\n","byline":"MAURICE NEWMAN ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Opinion/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T10:10:45.000Z","description":"FOR all the public outcry over the lack of fairness and equity in the budget, scarcely a word is uttered in defence of future generations.

covering half his total $186,868 in salary and expenses.\n\nUnder questioning from counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar SC, Mr Berger said he spent about half his time in Tasmania on superannuation business.\n\n“So the invoice that was put in claims $93,000 for two and a half days’ work?” Mr Stoljar said.\n\nMr Berger answered: “Well that’s the maths.” The commission heard the arrangement was at the discretion of the branch secretary, that no advertisement was made for the position and that Mr Berger was not required to hold any qualifications for the role.\n\nThe SLO role included giving promotional material to workers, making sure super fund members were receiving statements and advising non-fund member workers to compare TWU Super’s performance.\n\nMr Berger said he did not see it as problematic that TWU Super was paying large sums to the union.\n\nThe royal commission is inquiring into the TWU and its relationship with TWU Super as part of its broader inquiry into union governance.\n\nMr Stoljar said in his opening address that TWU Super was an important revenue stream for the TWU, paying $200,000 a year in directors’ fees, $500,000 a year in reimbursement for salaries and SLO expenses and $100,000 in sponsorship.\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nAAP\n\n","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Industrial Relations/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T03:24:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:05:49.000Z","description":"A UNION-related superannuation fund was billed more than $93,000 for two and a half days’ work done by a union official, an inquiry has heard.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/twu-billed-super-fund-93k-for-two-days-work/story-fn59noo3-1226975166358?sv=e92fb8a2a0a85ad07beb26178c796255","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"c8db473f97ba0c3db18119102ece4f64","keywords":["super fund","transport workers","union-related superannuation fund","Tasmania Superannuation Liaison","Superannuation Liaison Officer","Tasmania","Peter Trute","John Berger","superannuation business","Transport Workers Union","super fund members","non-fund member workers","covering transport workers","commission shows"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/twu-billed-super-fund-93k-for-two-days-work/story-fn59noo3-1226975166358?sv=e92fb8a2a0a85ad07beb26178c796255","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975166358","originalSource":"AAP","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Industrial Relations/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"9b941b70a3114ad73151d9048c184e34","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975166326","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE TWU billed a superannuation fund thousands of dollars for just two days’ work done by an official.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"TWU billed super fund $93k for two days’ work","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Super fund billed $93k by union boss","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"d6372238-019c-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac -

Court documents show the money was paid to two entities — Media Circus ­Network, a media agency involved in Mr Palmer’s costly federal ­election campaign, and Cosmo Developments.\n\nMr Palmer denies any wrongdoing. But the seriousness of the matters means they are likely to be referred to police.\n\nRecords show that, after 14 years as a director, Mr Palmer resigned from Cosmo Developments in late May, a fortnight after it was first revealed in The Australian that Mineralogy had been ­accused in the Federal Court in Perth of wrongfully siphoning $10m in August last year and a further $2.167m just days before the September 7 federal election.\n\nAustralian Securities & Investments Commission records show Mr Palmer ended his role at Cosmo Developments on May 25, the same day his nephew, Clive Mensink, joined as sole director of the company, having been ­appointed the company secretary in May last year. Mr Mensink, the head of ore supply at the resources tycoon’s Queensland Nickel refin­ery in Townsville, did not return The Australian’s call yesterday.\n\nHowever, other documentary records show Mr Palmer’s resignation as a director of Cosmo Devel­opments was not detected publicly because it was omitted from his May 27 update of a federal parliament “register of members’ interests”.\n\nIn this May 27 update, which bears a May 29 stamp from the parliamentary registry, Mr Palmer disclosed that he had resigned as a director of the four most prominent and significant companies in his business group — Mineralogy, QNI Metals, QNI Resources and Queensland Nickel. There was no mention of Cosmo Developments.\n\nAsked by The Australian yesterday if he had resigned from Cosmo Developments to distance himself from the $10m in Chinese funds that went into the company from the NAB cheque account, Mr Palmer did not respond. He did not reply to a question about why his May 27 update to parliament did not disclose his resignation from Cosmo Developments.\n\nHowever, Mr Palmer issued a tweet in which he said that The Australian was a “real threat to democracy”.\n\n“I’ll be commencing defamation action against Hedley Thomas over latest erroneous smear,’’ tweeted Mr Palmer, who already has ongoing defamation proceedings against this reporter, The Australian, the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and his Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney.\n\nMr Palmer, Mr Mensink and others have been warned in subpoenas and legal orders that they face arrest if they do not hand over certain documents and ­information.\n\nMedia Circus is understood to have been subcontracted by ­another Brisbane advertising agency, Coroneo, which worked directly for Mr Palmer.\n\nOver the past three years, the Bank of China, on behalf of the government of China, has deposited more than $23m, including the $12.167m, that went missing.\n\nLawyers for Citic Pacific claim the money withdrawn from the ­account, which Mr Palmer controlled, could not have been legitimately spent on what he has described as “port management services”. This is because the amounts withdrawn were “exorbitant”, according to Citic Pacific, and Mineralogy was not operating the port.\n\nMedia Circus Network’s role and expertise in helping clients build brands and profile through advertising campaigns has nothing to do with the management of a remote iron ore port.\n\nMr Palmer denied he used Chinese government money to help pay for his campaign, claiming it was a “complete untruth”.\n\nTony Abbott said: “That’s a matter between Mr Palmer and the people who are claiming there is an issue.\n\n“Obviously, there is a dispute on and let’s see how that gets ­resolved,” the Prime Minister said.\n\n","byline":"Hedley Thomas and Rosie Lewis ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/business/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T10:51:53.000Z","description":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments, which had received $10 million of ­Chinese funds allegedly wrong­fully siphoned from a National Australia Bank account, are being forensically examined amid a quasi-judicial probe into the missing cash.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/probe-into-clive-palmers-missing-12m-widens/story-e6frg8zx-1226974297124?sv=b53936beee0d02d18877e401a8e895b3","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"f181c84c97b9a951e22dde1246fdd2fb","keywords":["federal election campaign","iron ore port","federal eelction campaign","ongoing defamation proceedings","express contractual purpose","Chinese government money","Supreme Court","Bank of China Limited","Federal Court","Citic Pacific Ltd.","National Australia Bank Limited","Queensland Nickel","iron ore","federal election","Chinese funds","Rosie Lewis","confidential arbitration proceedings","Chinese state-owned company","defamation action","investigation process","remote iron ore","federal parliament","port management services","reasonable expenses","cheque account","Western Australia","Australia","Perth","China","Queensland","Brisbane","Tony Abbott","Richard Chesterman","Jeff Seeney","Campbell Newman","Palmer","Hedley Thomas"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/probe-into-clive-palmers-missing-12m-widens/story-e6frg8zx-1226974297124?sv=b53936beee0d02d18877e401a8e895b3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974297124","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","related":[],"standFirst":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments are being investigated.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments, which received $10 million of Chinese funds allegedly wrongfully siphoned from a National Australia Bank account, are being forensically examined amid a quasi-judicial probe into the missing cash. \n\nThe ultimate destination of the cash from the $10m cheque, No. 2046, which was drawn on the NAB account on August 8, is now a major part of a rapidly escalating investigation process being conducted in confidential arbitration proceedings led by a retired Supreme Court judge, Richard Chesterman, QC.\n\n","subtitle":"Probe into Clive Palmer’s missing $12m widens","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Glenn Barnes"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Probe into Palmer’s missing $12m widens","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6292cc18-00ea-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d -

Robinson’s brother claimed to have lost his phone at the races before the image found its way on to social media.\n\nApart from his public appearance on Nine, Carney remained holed up in his Cronulla home yesterday where he was visited by several teammates who are unhappy with the club for his sudden sacking.\n\n“I just hope that this isn’t the end of me as a footballer,’’ an emotional Carney said.\n\n“It’s definitely not going to be the end of me as a person. I’m stronger than that.\n\n“I’ve been through this situation before but this is probably the toughest (one). It’s just disappointing. It’s something that I didn’t know was out there and didn’t know it would ever surface like this.\n\n“To receive the message on Saturday night was just gut wrenching. It made me feel sick straight away.\n\n“It was just a prank. The boys have seen me muck around doing it before and I didn’t think there was a photo going to be taken and definitely didn’t think there was going to be a photo in public.\n\n“As much as it’s hurt Cronulla as a club and my career, it’s hurt my pride and my dignity as a person. It’s hurt my mum and sisters.’’\n\nCarney’s heartfelt plea will fall on deaf ears as Doyle’s statement indicates the game has finally lost patience with the former Dally M Medal winner after Cronulla became the third club in six years to show him the door.\n\nThe Raiders were the first to sack him in 2008 after a string of offences, including urinating on the head and neck of a man in the trough of a Canberra nightspot. The NRL backed the club by banning Carney for the 2009 season.\n\nHe was thrown a lifeline by the Sydney Roosters in 2010 and gave up alcohol for the season on his way to being crowned the game’s best player.\n\nHowever he slipped back into his bad old ways and was sacked in 2011 after several alcohol-related incidents.\n\nWith the NRL no longer his safety net, Carney could be forced to look overseas for opportunities but any hopes he has of joining the English Super League look doomed as his criminal record would make it difficult for him to obtain a working visa.\n\nCarney has faced court a number of times during his career, including for a drunken rampage in Goulburn in 2009 (the magistrate banned him from his home town) and for drink-driving in 2011 (he was warned he would go to jail if he faced court again).\n\nThat could leave Carney faced with the prospect of switching codes with French rugby union his most likely option. He could also return to Atherton in north Queensland where he played in 2009 during his exile and worked as a barman.\n\n","byline":"Stuart Honeysett ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/NRL/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-06-30T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-30T11:58:38.000Z","description":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents, the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/its-all-over-nrl-bans-todd-carney-for-life/story-fnca0von-1226972926592?sv=af0a443549dc3e9c7114fbc90988f53c","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"153cfcc05731c3083430263ecf577e28","keywords":["chief operating officer","French rugby union","worded statement","criminal record","sudden sacking","working visa","Sydney Roosters","Luke Lewis","Paul Gallen","Jim Doyle","Todd Carney","Danny Weidler","Steve Noyce","Adam Taylor","Mick Robinson","alcohol-related incidents","Adam taylor","social media","switching codes","heartfelt plea","public appearance","multi-million dollar","Queensland","Australia","Cronulla","New South Wales","Cronulla Sharks"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/its-all-over-nrl-bans-todd-carney-for-life/story-fnca0von-1226972926592?sv=af0a443549dc3e9c7114fbc90988f53c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972926592","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/NRL/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"2578e7cd69eae6b5f214b8e024d53ef3","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"cwZnZpbjpUonYqsf7e4jmPWvePWy-Ljd","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"ffba0e0b3f683bdf55679cecf83eac74","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"pqMW1pbjrxk9rqI5yTE_iBAK_elmzAzz","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"93614f92368a16da292c132bc4863b43","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925366","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"fc58e073de39e74a6abfe8383868d604","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925420","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"0e7660a0b13b544075ab3ad715c66ce7","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925446","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents, the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life. \n\nHaving already lost his multi-million dollar contract at Cronulla after a photograph was published on social media of him indulging in a lewd act at a pub urinal, the NRL issued a strongly worded statement which suggested he had no future in the competition.\n\n","subtitle":"It’s all over: NRL bans Todd Carney for life","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Adam Taylor"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Todd Carney at Sydney airport after the Sharks returned from Brisbane after their shock win over the Broncos on Friday night Picture: Adam Taylor","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8ae63d98-0005-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

Under the proposal, a simplified payment would stop at a certain percentage of the cost of childcare and be whittled down to nothing for families on very high incomes.\n\nThe present childcare rebate is not means-tested and provides parents with 50 per cent of their childcare costs up to a total of $7500 a year for each child.\n\nThe Australian understands the commission wants to simplify the childcare payment stream to target it to families where it would generate the biggest public return for the taxpayer money spent. It believes payments are going to high-income families that would be participating in the workforce regardless of the rebate.\n\nBusiness groups have opposed means-testing, with the only group to back it being the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThe trade union movement has broken ranks with Bill Shorten’s Labor opposition and is pushing the Productivity Commission to means-test the childcare rebate, arguing that the money given to high-income families above $150,000 a year should be redirected to poorer families.\n\nBoth the peak national trade union, the ACTU, and Unions NSW are arguing for means-testing, with the latter saying the phasing out of the payment should start at $150,000 of household income.\n\nTaxpayers spent $6.5 billion last financial year on subsidies and rebates for childcare, rising to $7.6bn in 2016-17.\n\nAcross the next four years, spending will total $28bn.\n\nChildcare spending will nearly triple in a decade as more working parents demand daycare and wage costs soar, the federal Education Department recently warned.\n\nParents’ out-of-pocket costs will double as a proportion of household income during the next six years, the department reveals in new modelling for the Productivity Commission’s childcare inquiry. The analysis shows that high childcare fees discourage parents from working more than three days a week.\n\nThe Productivity Commission also argues that before and after-school-hours care should not be subjected to the requirement in the national quality framework for qualified educators to be included in all childcare settings.\n\nThe report is understood to back strongly 15 hours a week of preschool for four-year-olds, a proposal that would require increased government funding. The federal government has not funded its component of the preschool funding agreement with the states beyond its conclusion in December, prompting the states to claim they will reduce the number of hours of preschool they fund.\n\nThe report says the centre-based childcare system is most beneficial for children who are disadvantaged, and urges that the system needing to target “at risk” children who benefit enormously from formal long daycare.\n\nThe report will also discuss the new paid parental leave scheme — capped now at $100,000 per mother for six months of leave. It is understood to discuss how the money that will be generated from taxing big business for the scheme could be spent, including on childcare.\n\nThe National Quality Framework is broadly supported by the Productivity Commission, but the report will analyse where it has gone too far.\n\n","byline":"PATRICIA KARVELAS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Budget 2014/Family &amp; Welfare/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T15:37:20.000Z","description":"THE nation’s childcare system faces a significant shake-up, with a draft Productivity Commission report suggesting families be able to access one simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/push-to-allow-subsidies-for-nannies-as-childcare-means-test-in-frame/story-fn59niix-1226974432181?sv=8ad99f2adc82bf58ad7d183d6f8b87f3","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"04242549deefe63f0d0b9936d6b3bfe9","keywords":["income families","childcare payment","childcare rebate","education qualifications","childcare settings","childcare costs","nanny scheme","nanny program","taxpayer money","national quality framework","national trade union","childcare system","means test","marginal tax rates","preschool funding agreement","secondary earners","trade union movement","Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry","Bill Shorten"],"kicker":"EXCLUSIVE","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/push-to-allow-subsidies-for-nannies-as-childcare-means-test-in-frame/story-fn59niix-1226974432181?sv=8ad99f2adc82bf58ad7d183d6f8b87f3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974432181","originalAssetId":"1226974432181","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f4428e246bad09d848112c6d343acbd9","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974432153","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A DRAFT Productivity report suggets families have access to a simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE nation’s childcare system faces a significant shake-up, with a draft Productivity Commission report suggesting families be able to access one simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies. \n\nTHE nation’s childcare system faces a major shake-up, with the Productivity Commission’s draft report suggesting one simplified payment with a means test that tapers down for high income families, as well as allowing parents to claim the payment for the use of nannies.\n\n","subtitle":"Push to allow subsidies for nannies as childcare means test in frame","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Monkey Business Images Ltd"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Childcare means test in frame","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"e59444ec-0104-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["child","generic","taking care","woman reading","working mother","mother","reading"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226974428463?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974428463","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974432127","subtitle":"e59444ec-0104-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d","title":"Childcare means test in frame","width":100},"title":"Childcare means test in frame"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said the death reported overnight was believed to be the result of a “non-combat related incident’’.

His death will impact the nation and we will do all we can to support his family, his friends and his colleagues through the difficult days ahead.\n\n“ADF personnel secured the site overnight to allow coalition Military Police to collect evidence and the Australian Defence Force investigative service has now commenced its investigation.”\n\nThe soldier was serving in the ADF headquarters in Kabul and Air Chief Marshal Binskin said he would not be drawn on speculation about the incident.\n\nThe ADF’s investigative service has begun collecting evidence from the site, he said.\n\n“At this early stage we don’t have all the facts,’’ he said.\n\n“I’m not in a position to speculate about the details or the circumstances surrounding the incident.’’\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Warren Truss offered his sympathies to the soldier’s family, describing the news as tragic considering that Australia’s engagement in Afghanistan has largely ended.\n\n“It is a tragedy that after Australia’s official engagement has largely wound down that we should lose another Australian in Afghanistan,” Mr Truss said.\n\n“I understand there is still 400 Australians in Afghanistan and while the level of danger might not be as great as it was at the height of the war, there’s certainly risks of being in a war zone like Afghanistan.’’\n\nWhen Tony Abbott announced the conclusion of the withdrawal from Oruzgan in December, he said the 12-year war had “been worth it”.\n\n“If you look at the benefits for our country, for Afghanistan, and for the wider world, then my conclusion is yes, it has been worth it,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Abbott said the 400 remaining soldiers would “keep an eye on things” and said there was the possibility they could get “caught up in” combat activity.\n\nAt the time, Mr Abbott rejected concerns Afghan authorities would not be able to maintain stability.\n\nA total of 25,000 Australian troops have served in Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.\n\n* Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78.\n\n","byline":"Rosie Lewis ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Defence/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T01:12:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T01:12:58.000Z","description":"AN Australian special forces soldier has died from a gunshot wound in Afghanistan.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/afghanistan-mission-claims-another-life-with-soldier-found-dead-in-kabul/story-e6frg8yo-1226974752300?sv=625a445cff11d6d738a7846f0025e05d","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"70cb47cdbf83231a30f19a070cda4ad1","keywords":["Australian soldiers","Kabul","Afghanistan","Kandah&#226;r","Defence Force","Marshal Mark Binskin","Australian special","overseas combat deployment","combat mission"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/afghanistan-mission-claims-another-life-with-soldier-found-dead-in-kabul/story-e6frg8yo-1226974752300?sv=625a445cff11d6d738a7846f0025e05d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974752300","originalAssetId":"1226974752300","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Defence/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"cf7ee33dd375db574178b33c7bd39953","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"dlMmVtbjpZLK8GIr0xyMNpO_7wSa506d","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"AN Australian special forces soldier has died from a gunshot wound in Afghanistan.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Afghanistan mission claims another life, with soldier found dead in Kabul","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Gary Ramage"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Afghanistan mission claims another life ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"fe20aac2-017d-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

A loss of 50,000 jobs from the sector would represent a decline of 20 per cent, or 28 per cent should 75,000 jobs fall.\n\nMr Fabo emphasised it was not clear how many of the workers losing their resource-related jobs would end up unemployed. The foreign workers component could return home, and others could be absorbed by other parts of the economy, albeit not on the above-average wages of the resources industry.\n\nThat latter point meant that there could be an out-sized impact on household income and spending. The resources industry is capital rather than job-­intensive. It is not a big employer of workers either way, accounting for only 2 per cent of the total workforce of 11.5 million people. But it does underpin ANZ expectations that Australia’s trade balance will improve from a deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2012 to a surplus of more than 2 per cent over the next three years.\n\nDespite being more bearish than most on iron ore prices, the ANZ expects iron ore exports — Australia’s biggest — to grow from $55bn in 2012 to $75bn by 2020, helped in part by a fall in the dollar to about US84c.\n\nExports of LNG, where $170bn in investment in Queensland and Western ­Australia is fast coming to an end, are forecast to rise in value from $15bn in 2013 to $67bn in 2020.\n\nAnd despite the hit on jobs, Canberra is set to benefit from additional company tax revenue.\n\n“This phase of the mining boom, however, will not be as lucrative as Phase I,” ANZ said.\n\n","byline":"BARRY FITZGERALD

the development of Australia’s far north, has invested in the agribusiness sector, after two decades spent building up her private company, Hancock Prospecting, into a mining behemoth.\n\n“She is really putting her money where her mouth is,” said a person familiar with the deal.\n\nHancock Prospecting said today it had bought a 50 per cent interest in the Liveringa and Nerrima cattle stations, which measure a combined 4700 sq km.\n\nThe Australian understands that Hancock Prospecting had been negotiating the deal for about eight months and is also close to finalising talks to purchase other pastoral assets in the region, as part of a quest by Mrs Hancock to become a key player in the industry.\n\nMrs Rinehart’s mining rival, Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest, is embarking on a similar quest after buying Western Australia’s biggest beef producer, Harvey Beef, for more than $30 million in May.\n\nThe twin deals confirm that Mrs Rinehart and Mr Forrest view the potential growth in demand for Australian beef is in the same way they have grown rich from China’s soaring demand for the Pilbara’s iron ore over the past decade.\n\nThe largely untapped Chinese market is seen as the holy grail for the Australian beef industry, both for processed beef and live cattle exports.\n\nIn another deal last month, WA meat processor V & V Walsh entered a $1 billion joint venture with the Inner Mongolian government and a Chinese farming group that will provide a massive boost to the company’s lamb and cattle exports to China.\n\nHancock said today it had entered a 50:50 joint venture to buy the cattle stations with the Laitt family’s private company Dowford Investments, the parent of Milne Agrigroup, one of WA’s biggest agribusiness groups.\n\nMilne Agrigroup’s businesses include Milne Feeds, Mt Barker Free Range Chicken and Plantagenet Free Range Pork.\n\nThe joint venture has also acquired the mothballed Waroona Abattoirs, which was previously one of WA’s biggest meat processors.\n\nHancock said it had invested in the venture to provide capital and commercial knowledge to support the industry as it targets expansion into global markets.\n\n“Australia’s north has vast potential as a food producer and we are well placed to meet the growing needs of our Asian neighbours,” Mrs Rinehart said.\n\n“We are already exporting some of the finest produce in the world.\n\n“My family has had a long history in the West Australian pastoral industry with our interest continuing over generations in Mulga Downs Station in the Pilbara.\n\n“I spent part of my childhood growing up on Mulga Downs and in the Pilbara, and have had a life-long regard for people in the outback, particularly in Northern Australia,” she said.\n\nMilne Agrigroup managing director Graham Laitt said he was pleased to welcome an investor with Hancock’s capital and knowledge of export markets.\n\n“We are especially pleased that Mrs Rinehart has been attracted to Liveringa and Nerrima,” he said.\n\n“The first step for the industry is for it to increase its scale so that it can be a reliable supplier in the emerging export markets.”\n\n","byline":"Andrew Burrell

I’m just so glad that it’s brought about more awareness of Crohn’s disease, and it’s made me feel so much more confident.”\n\nBethany was fitted with her colostomy bags after battling with Crohn’s disease since the age of three. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, affecting the sufferer’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste.\n\nIn extreme situations like Bethany’s, it becomes necessary to remove the damaged section of the intestine and bring the healthy part out as a stoma — known as a colostomy.\n\nAfter almost dying when her bowel ruptured in 2010, Bethany woke from a life-saving operation to find she had been fitted with two colostomy bags.\n\n“Growing up I’d had various surgeries to try and combat the Crohn’s,” said Townsend. “I’d go in and have sections of my intestine cut out, but I’d only be in remission for a couple of weeks before it came back again.\n\n“Then, four years ago I woke up in the morning and couldn’t move because I was in so much agony. I had to break a glass on the floor to alert my mum who called on ambulance. When the paramedics came they lifted up my top to see that my surgery scar had split open. I was rushed to intensive care where they doctors told me family I would need more surgery as my intestines had become infected and inflamed again. I had no idea when I woke up that I would have the bags.\n\n“When I first woke up and my mum told me about them I was just relieved as I’d thought I was going to die. When I came out of hospital and everything finally sunk in, I remember going upstairs into my bedroom and just bursting into tears.\n\n“I’d known a colostomy bag might have been an option but it was always something that I had wanted to avoid. I had a really good cry that day, and since then I haven’t shed another tear — I’ve just got on with it I suppose.”\n\nIt was only after Townsend met and married her husband, Ian, 33, and jetted off to Mexico last Christmas that she finally felt ready to embrace the colostomy bags.\n\n“When I met Ian I showed him my bags straight away, but he didn’t bat an eye lid — I actually felt like I was overreacting,” she said.\n\n“He taught me that there was more to me than the bags and would always encourage me to show off my figure. I wasn’t sure but in Mexico I finally realised he was right, and decided to wear my bikini.\n\n“At first I was nervous and worried that people would stare but it was fine. The staff at the hotel asked me about the bags on the last day of the holiday, but rather than being offended I was glad because it meant I could talk to them about Crohn’s and tell them what it is.\n\n“I decided to get in touch with Crohn’s and Colitis UK Facebook group to see if they would let me post something on their page. I sent them the picture and my information, and it all blew up from there.”\n\nTownsend still suffers from Crohn’s disease and hopes ones day for a cure, but for now she is considering getting back into modelling — a career she gave up on after she was fitted with the bags.\n\n“I feel confident enough now to put myself out there and pursue modelling again,” she said.\n\n“I did a little bit of work here and there before I had the colostomy bags, but once I had them fitted I thought that was the end of the dream. I’m looking forward to chasing my goals, and I know now that nothing can hold me back.\n\n“I won’t let the Crohn’s control me anymore.”\n\n","byline":"Caters News ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle -

The tape is applied to an injured muscle or tendon and as the muscle or joint lengthens, the tape is stretched to absorb load and reduce the work on the muscles. This results in decreased workload, demand on the muscle and improved tolerance to fatigue.\n\nManaging Director of Dynamic Tape, Ryan Kendrick, told news.com.au he had no idea Kyrgios was using his Tribal Tape, but wasn’t surprised that people mistook the product for a real tattoo.\n\n“When I have worn it myself people often ask to see my tattoo and I have had many of my patients recount funny stories like an 85-year-old great grandmother whose son was disgusted with her as he thought she had gone out and got some ink!” he said.\n\nHe said Ana Ivanovic and Sania Mirzer used the tan tattoo version of the product at the Australian Open earlier this year while Tommy Haas wore the black tattoo design. Serena Williams, Laura Robson and Kim Clijsters have also used the product.\n\nKendrick said the tattoo design came about because he was living on Norfolk Island when the tape was developed and wanted to reflect the heritage of the island and the South Pacific.\n\n“The design was given to us by a very well known Polynesian artist and tattooist named Tihoti. Tihoti is Tahitian but his wife is a Norfolk Islander. Norfolk relies heavily on tourism and with the global financial crisis and high Australian Dollar, they were suffering so it was our way of spreading the word about Norfolk Island a little.”\n\nKinesio Australia Education Director, Clint Bridges, says while the tribal tape is not an official Kinesio product, the Kinesio taping method is regularly used on the tennis circuit.\n\n“Novak Djokovic, Li Na and Serena Williams all use a beige form of the tape on court. At a base level, it’s used to try and change the way the muscle is firing. There are specific tensions for different tasks which changes the way the brain thinks that muscle is working.\n\n“Certain tensions provide stimulus on the skin, which sends a message to the brain. The brain then reinterprets that message and sends instructions back to the muscle so it learns how to behave. There would be one tension for relaxation of the muscle if it’s tight and one for activation.”\n\nKendrick said the tape was released commercially in Australia in late 2010, followed by the UK and then North America in 2012. The tape was used by a number of athletes at the London 2012 games and is now available in 25 countries.\n\nSo there you have it, for all those out there wanting the Kyrgios tattoo, you’re in luck.\n\nFor just $15.10, you can buy five metres of the stuff.\n\nWere you fooled by Kyrgios’ tattoo?

That statistic is simply breathtaking — especially against nine-time French Open champion Nadal.\n\nFaced with the most ferocious grand slam competitor in the world, Kyrgios did not lose a single first serve point, winning all 19 while gunning down 13 aces and thumping 22 clean winners.\n\nAnd he was able to maintain momentum despite Nadal using every piece of his devastating artillery.\n\nImpossibly laid back, Kyrgios seized the ascendancy by blasting drives past frustrated Nadal.\n\nUnfazed at letting slip a set point on Nadal’s serve in the 12th game, Kyrgios romped through the tiebreak after surging to a 4-0 lead.\n\nMaintaining incredible serving levels, the teenager produced the shot of the tournament midway through the second set, with a half-volley winner — played off a bare baseliner and between the legs.\n\nIn control, he will long rue a sloppy service game at 6-5.\n\nDespite holding game points, he dropped serve for the first time in the match — and the set.\n\nNadal’s relief was palpable as the Spanish bull jabbed his fist in delight. It had taken him 95 minutes to create the first crack in Kyrgios’s arsenal.\n\nNo player in international tennis saps energy from opponent like Nadal. Impressively, Kyrgios continued to trade heavyweight blows with the world champion.\n\nAnd when the tyro twice survived serving crisis deep in the third set before unleashing a monster forehand return Nadal could only push wide to lose the tiebreak, centre court erupted.\n\nKrygios’s father George and sister Halimah jumped to their feet in jubilation as he grabbed the third set with classic stand-and-deliver missile.\n\nMore assured with every exchange, Kyrgios pressured Nadal into unforced forehand error in the fourth game of the fourth set as the prospect of miracle victory became reality.\n\nServing for the match, Kyrgios didn’t blink, sealing the issue with an ace.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink in London

the 84-year-old’s credibility and in the moment it was shown in court, his fortunes were dramatically altered.\n\nIt was a turning point from which Harris’ case never truly recovered.\n\nFor days on the witness stand Harris had denied that he had indecently assaulted a then 14-year-old waitress at a celebrity sports contest in Cambridge in the 1970s for no other reason than he had never done the contest.\n\n‘OMG I’M SO HAPPY’: Rolf’s victim Tonya Lee speaks out \n\nLINGERING FOREVER: The headlines that will haunt Rolf Harris \n\nCHILLING WORDS: Rolf Harris starred in Kids Can Say No! to sex abuse video \n\nANOTHER VICTIM: Aussie woman claims rolf Harris assaulted her too \n\nHarris went further and said he had only ever done such a show in Florida in the US and had only been to the historic Cambridge city two years ago for the first time.\n\nHe was adamant, particularly about the latter point and mentioned it more than once, with his statements were widely reported.\n\nIt was then a member of the public tipped off authorities and they discovered not only was there such a celebrity sports event but it was a TV show called “Star Games”. Footage showed not only had Harris partaken but he captained the team and did a large televised painting at the event — all of which occurred at Cambridge.\n\nThe dramatic discovery of the 1978 TV footage disrupted the trial as the jury, which did not know then of the footage discovery, had to be retired to allow legal parties to argue for their respective inclusion and exclusion.\n\nDefence lawyers knew its inclusion would go to the heart of their client’s credibility in the eyes of the jury since he was so sure on the stand of his evidence, with no-one at that point able to contradict.\n\nHis defence on that indictment — groping the 14-year-old on the buttocks in what she thought was about 1976 — revolved about his denial of the event and city. They tried unsuccessfully to have the footage blocked from inclusion on the grounds of fairness and prejudice and said their defence would have been different if the 1978 footage was known about.\n\nBoth prosecution and defence said it was not an ideal situation for either side but Justice Nigel Sweeney agreed while the case was at a sensitive stage he accepted the prosecution’s argument and allowed the footage to be shown.\n\nHarris attempted to counter and said that he did not remember being on the program but accepted he was there but did not realise it was Cambridge and added no celebrities probably realised it was that city since they all just got bussed around the country and that was the nature of show business.\n\nHe repeatedly denied lying or tailoring his evidence to suit the evidence presented but the damage was done.\n\n","byline":"By CHARLES MIRANDA in London

Though he’s still a long way from contending at Slams, he’s a player to watch in the future, and not just when he goes through the legs.”\n\nJohn Branch, writing for the New York Times, was similarly I pressed with Kyrgios’ outing, noting he had become the “lowest-ranked player to beat Nadal since No. 690 Joachim Johansson beat him in Stockholm in 2006.”\n\n“Until the evening shadows fell on Centre Court Tuesday, the last time a teenager beat a No. 1 player at a Grand Slam event was at the 2005 French Open,” Branch wrote. “The winner was Rafael Nadal, over Roger Federer, a couple of days after Nadal’s 19th birthday.\n\nWildcard Nick Kyrgios just beat World No. 1 Nadal!

HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME\n\nThe “G” is silent. So “Kirr-ee-oss”. Not “Kurr-gee-oss”, like the spelling would suggest.\n\n2. HIS BACKGROUND\n\nKyrgios is Aussie born. A Canberra boy. His father, George, was born in Greece and moved to Australia as a child. His mother, Norlaila, is Malaysian.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest of three kids. His brother is a lawyer and his sister an actor.\n\n3. HE WAS A CHUBBY KID\n\nKyrgios’ mother, Norlaila, admits her boy ate too much as a child. He loved his food.\n\nBut he eventually stretched out into a lean 1.93m (6ft 4in), 77kg frame and lost the puppy fat.\n\nMORE: The shot that stunned the world \n\nMORE: Legends, celebs in shock over Aussie Nick \n\nMORE: Why you don’t need to cheer for Tomic anymore \n\n4. THE HISTORY HE’S CREATED\n\nWith his 7-6 (7-5), 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory over Nadal — one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon history — Kyrgios became the first teenager to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Nadal did it himself against Roger Federer in the 2005 French Open. An ominous sign.\n\nThe youngest man in the men’s draw, the 144th-ranked Kyrgios also became the first player ranked outside the top 100 to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Andrei Olhovsky defeated Jim Courier at Wimbledon in 1992.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon since compatriot Bernard Tomic in 2011 and the first to reach the quarter-finals on debut since German Florian Mayer 10 years ago.\n\n5. BASKETBALL BECKONED\nCanberra is boasting right now about being the home of Australia’s hottest sporting stars. NBA star Patty Mills, the “next big thing” in basketball Dante Exum and Kyrgios are all products of the nation’s capital. Kyrgios was a hoops-mad kid as well, representing Australia in basketball as a young teen before making tennis his sole focus as a 14-year-old. He still loves the Boston Celtics.\n\n6. THE MONEY GAME\n\nSince turning pro in 2013, Kyrgios has played only 10 matches on ATP Tour. Of those, he has only won three and lost seven (going into Wimbledon).\n\nThis year, he’d won just one match on the pro tour — the Australian Open first round against Benjamin Becker, the namesake of the man Kyrgios has been compared to quite a bit today, Boris Becker.\n\nWhat it all means is he’d won $A248,000 in his career up until Wimbledon. He will walk away from the All England Club with a minimum $A409,806 for reaching the quarter-finals. The Wimbledon champion takes home $A3.19 million.\n\n7. HIS IDOLS\n\nIf Kyrgios can shock the world once more and defeat Raonic tonight, he is on track to meet the man he looked up to most as a child, Roger Federer, in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Another guy he really idolised as a youngster was Nadal.\n\nKyrgios first started playing tennis at six years old, in 2001. By that stage, Federer had already been a pro for three years.\n\n8. HE LIKES RAP\n\nKyrgios is a Lil Wayne fan. And he was into Wu Tang as a kid. He also likes R’n’B artist Rihanna.\n\n9. HE WAS A TOP JUNIOR\n\nWhile top juniors don’t always make it big, Kyrgios was a junior world No. 1 and won the junior Australian Open in 2013, defeating countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis in the final.\n\n10. HE LOVES A LAUGH\n\nProving he is not just a serious tennis robot, Kyrgios loves a comedy and is a big Family Guy fan.\n\n","byline":"CAMERON TOMARCHIO ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Tennis/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Latest News/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Media i/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports Tennis news/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/foxsports.com.au/tennis/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/news.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T05:15:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T05:15:56.000Z","description":"ADMIT it.

the crème de la crème of boganism for 7mate’s reality show, Bogan Hunters, and the Apple Isle is certainly punching well above its weight.\n\nAfter an exhaustive process of elimination, celebrity judges Angry Anderson, Jonesy, Miss Nude Australia, Tahir Bilgic, Jacko, Chris Franklin, Derek Boyer and Rob Shehadie have selected seven finalists to go through to next Tuesday’s Bogan Hunters Grand Final.\n\nMore: Do bogans know they’re bogans and other important questions\n\nFenech told news.com.au that only the purest of bogans made it through.\n\n“When we started the series I thought it was a bit of a joke. But boganism is a culture. These guys are unashamedly bogans. They love it, they live it, they have a complete lack of any pretence. I reckon the bogan is the true Aussie battler of the new millennium.”\n\nAnd while they are all unique in their embracement of the “culture”, they all have one thing in common. \n\n“It’s a mystery, the teeth of the bogan,” added Fenech, “a bit like the Bermuda Triangle. Could be too many Beam and Cokes, I don’t know. But I would say more than 50 per cent of bogans do have some pretty interesting teeth, that’s for sure. It could be a money thing. It costs a lot to get your teeth fixed.”\n\nHe says the finalists are defined by: “Mullets, thongs, ugg boots, flannelettes, tight jeans, a love of Oz rock, home done tattoos are important, a lack of pretence is very important, as is a willingness to be incredibly honest at all time.”\n\nAustralia, meet your finalists:\n\nMEL: the kinky chick from Munno Para, South Australia \n\nSaid to perfectly represent the “female of the bogan species”. She once stabbed her partner in the neck with a pair of scissors because he poked her too much in the arm.\n\nANDREW: the dad to eight kids to three different mothers from Bridgewater, Tasmania \n\nHas the name of his eight kids tattooed on his arms, all the girls on one arm and the boys on the other. “I can’t remember their dates of birth cos I’m always too smashed. That way if I go to Centrelink and they ask me, well I can say ‘here we go, here’s the date of birth” he said as he showed off the ink.\n\nDARREN: the second worst driver in Tasmania, also from Bridgewater \n\nHas 52 charges of driving with no licence against his name and is proud of it. Has his own car graveyard full off abandoned wrecks. “What more do you want in life,” he said.\n\nNANNA SHAZZA: the larger-than-life GILF from Victoria’s bogan epicentre, Nar Nar Goon \n\nIs the “odds on favourite” to win. Loves her Holdens, Collingwood football team and exposing her breasts. Enjoys drinking a goon sack of wine hung from a clothesline.\n\nJUSTIN: the young chick magnet from St Helens, Tasmania \n\nIs the youngest bogan of the finalists. Sports a good array of tatts including an “Made in Australia” sign, a Southern Cross and the name of his son across his chest. Became a dad at 16 and is fiercely proud of his mullet which he describes as “nice and filthy”.\n\nFORDY: the wild man from Rocky aka Western Australia’s most bogan suburb, Rockingham \n\nCan swear mid-word, loves a nudie run, Ned Kelly, a barbecue and has an esky of beers kept next to his bed. Attempted to eat the rubber remnants left on the ground after a burnout.\n\nCLINT: the 50-something bogan “lifer” from George Town, Tasmania \n\nJudges said he “ticked so many bogan boxes”. Talked about his favourite sex position, doggie style, showed off his missus’ homemade tattoos and has an incredible collection of bogan friends. Lives in George Town which he describes as the “boganest place in the world”.\n\nThe Bogan Hunters Grand Final airs next Tuesday, July 8 at 9.30pm on 7mate. \n\nThe finalists will have to prove themselves once and for all in a final showdown of bogan appearance, attitude and sex appeal, before “Australia’s Greatest Bogan” is crowned.\n\nThe winner will be awarded the Golden Thong Award and the Aussie Pride ‘straya ute with kegs in the back, which Paul Fenech describes as a “sick, hectic, off-the-hook prize.”\n\n","byline":"Alison Stephenson  ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment -

Leave your comments below\n\nBoth thought the green and black racewear was also a major fashion fail.\n\n“My main issue is with the green and black suits and the emphasis on the crotch,” Ms Cant said.\n\n“The shaping in the crotch and with the black leg, something is not quite flattering.\n\n“It is drawing the eye to the wrong place, rather than to the athletic body and the overall look.”\n\nThe swimmers on the other hard were full of complements for the swimsuits.\n\n“Yeah really happy, they’re basic and sort of the same as we’ve had for the last year or so,” freestyler Bronte Barratt said.\n\n“The colours seem good, they’re majority green instead of majority black which is really good because that represents Australia.\n\n“We have the gold cap as well so it will look great.”\n\n","byline":"Kris Crane ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All

Michael Robertson.\n\nHe said he had been a forensic toxicologist for 20 years and had studied widely in his field.\n\nDr Robertson said he did a toxicological examination of the results obtained from Allison Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said the review was of Ms Baden-Clay’s post mortem results and the levels of a particular drugs, called sertraline.\n\n“Sertaline is the active drug within the commercial or trade name medication Zoloft,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said it was an anti-depressant and elevated levels of serotonin in the brain, or mood-elevating chemicals, to reduce depression.\n\nHe said sertraline was a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI), which increased levels of serotonin in the brain.\n\nHe said the drug would be broken down and metabolised into desmethyl sertraline.\n\nDr Robertson said the levels of sertraline in the blood of Ms Baden-CLay was .59mg/kg and levels of desmethyl sertraline were at 3.3mg/kg.\n\nHe said there was also some detected in the stomach and liver, at 5mg/kg and desmethly sertraline of 31mg/kg.\n\nDr Robertson said it was unusual for levels to be above 0.05mg/kg in a person.\n\nHe said average numbers he expected in a living person taking sertraline was 0.03mg/kg.\n\nHe said Ms Baden-Clay’s levels were elevated.\n\nHe said elevated levels could be caused by the ingestion of a different amount of drug to the recommended therapeutic amount.\n\nDr Robertson said there were a number of side-effects for sertraline, including common adverse effects such as anxiety, agitation, confusion, thermo-regulation or an elevation of temperature, and even serotonin syndrome or toxicity.\n\n“This is a well described adverse event that involves unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said serotonin effects varied from individual to individual.\n\nDr Robertson said serotonin syndrome occurred when levels were too high and started to affect other areas of the brain.\n\n“When you get too much of this drug you can get situations again where more profound confusion might exist in a general way, increased agitation, unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said studies showed individuals who were taking “SSRIs” were more likely to experience suicidal ideation.\n\n“The mechanism behind that is simply unclear… it usually happens when someone first starts to take medication or alters medication, those sort of things,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson agreed Allison would have likely developed a tolerance to the drug.\n\nHe said sertraline was usually reported as a multi-drug cause of death, rather than a drug alone.\n\nHe agreed the levels of serotonin in the blood were not consistent with an overdose causing death.\n\nProsecutor's heated questions: 'You killed your wife, Mr Baden-Clay?'\n\nFollow the trial day by day

placate both the true believers and sceptics? Not likely.\n\nProving the existence of the Himalayan yeti, and its North American cousin Bigfoot, has been the objective of decades of amateur research.\n\nSightings of the hairy “ape men” abound, yet hard evidence proves elusive.\n\nUS GOVERNMENT MEMO: How to hunt Yetis \n\nAre they survivors of long-lost species, such as Homo Neanderthalensis or ancient Gigantopithecus apes? Are they embodiments of mythology, such as half-human were-bears?\n\nThere are plenty of books. There are plenty of documentaries.\n\nBut where’s the real scientific research?\n\nUnderstandably, evidence-based science has largely avoided this arena where belief has a tendency to trump truth.\n\nBut: “Advocates frequently complain that they have been rejected by science,” a University of Oxford study points published in today’s edition of the Proceedings of The Royal Society “B”.\n\nThis conflicts with “the basic tenet that science neither rejects nor accepts anything without examining the evidence,” the researchers write.\n\nSo they did.\n\nThe team made up of Zoologists, geneticists and biologists from Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States have now carried out the first scientific publication report into the genetics of material attributed to “anomalous primates”.\n\nTheir findings?\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? Have your say in the comments box, below.\n\nEven in this modern age of high-definition smartphone videos and cameras, what few images do emerge are grainy, out-of-focus and leave much to the imagination. And smeared, oversizes footprints aren’t enough.\n\nBut over the years a few pieces have been presented as substantive signs of the sasquatch: Most commonly, hair.\n\nGALLERY: Yeti fever — big, bad monsters \n\nTufts of “sasquatch fluff” abound. There even examples of “yeti” scalps.\n\nHair contains DNA. DNA can be analysed and compared to known species to provide strong evidence of its origins.\n\n“To introduce some clarity into this often murky field, we have carried out a systematic genetic survey of hair samples attributed to these creatures,” the researchers write.\n\nTo achieve this they set about gathering samples from museums and private collections all over the world — some 57 in all — and put them all to the test.\n\nMacroscopic, microscopic and infra-red fluorescence methods were brought to bear: And that was just to eliminate the inevitable contamination presented by natural fibres (a nice way of saying forgeries).\n\nThe screening left 36 samples as being potentially “real”. These formed the basis of genetic analysis.\n\nIndividual strands were put in the blender and their DNA extracted and identified.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n— Six black bears\n\n— Two polar bears\n\n— One brown bear\n\n— Four cows\n\n— Four horses\n\n— Four dogs\n\n— Two raccoons\n\n— One Malaysian tapir\n\n— One deer\n\n— One sheep\n\n— One porcupine\n\n— One human\n\n— One serow\n\nSerow what?\n\nDon’t get too excited. It’s a goatlike antelope from Central Asia.\n\nSo, no Yetis.\n\nBut wait: There is wiggle room.\n\nThe above lists only 30 of the 36 samples.\n\n“Seven samples failed to yield any DNA sequences despite multiple attempts,” the researchers argue.\n\nUsing different techniques, most of these were still linked to animals native to the Himalays. But there remains two “anomalies” where DNA and other techniques failed to provide even a hint.\n\n“With the exception of these two samples, none of the submitted and analysed hairs samples returned a sequence that could not be matched with an extant mammalian species,” the researchers write.\n\n“While it is important to bear in mind that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and this survey cannot refute the existence of anomalous primates, neither has it found any evidence in support,” they conclude.\n\nClear sign of conspiracy? That’s up to you.\n\nBut the most intriguing aspect of the analysis may be that one of the polar bear samples belonged to a variety known only in Pleistocene fossils, not living examples.

My dad owns half of f***ing Manhattan.”\n\nHe also claims he also has both the police and Mayor Bill DeBlasio on his side. Oh and he’s apparently a lawyer too.\n\n“You think a guy who does real estate doesn’t own the cops?”.\n\nBut if that isn’t bad enough; surprise, surprise it turns out Gerry Adjmi isn’t who he says he is at all.\n\nDespite deleting all his social media accounts, US website The Smoking Gun  discovered he isn’t actually who he says he is.\n\nAs it turns out the drunken student is actually Gerry Shalam, a New Jersey man whose father Lou is a garment industry executive, and his mother Frieda an event co-ordinator and member of the Allenhurst Borough zoning and planning board.\n\nThe video, and his apparent claim to fame has attracted a raft of attention on social media with some people calling him a “terrible man child” while others called his behaviour disgusting.\n\n#GerryShalam -BWAAAAAAA!\n\n— Randall Ellis (@rketexas) July 1, 2014 \n\nGerry Shalam is actually a student of #NYU. No surprise that a self-indulgent capitalist is already attending there http://t.co/f7hV8U0Zse\n\n— Donithan (@trollshevikism) July 1, 2014 \n\nSo looks like the drunken NYU students dad who owns half of Manhattan, doesn't actually own half of Manhattan. #gerryshalam\n\n— Tom Strong-Grinsell (@TomSG_) July 1, 2014 \n\nThat terrible manchild who drunkenly proclaimed his father owns half of manhattan is from, of course, New Jersey: http://t.co/2KGm1Yk0QJ\n\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) July 1, 2014 \n\nThis whole Gerry Shalam thing is disgusting. I hope he gets expelled from NYU\n\n— Storey (@storey_ofmylife) July 1, 2014 \n\nAnd while Mr Shalam may be regretting his behaviour, at least he’s not quite as bad as the YouTube clip makes him out to be.\n\nThe 20-year-old co-founded a charitable organisation called Brothers Helping Others that helps low-income immigrant families in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n\nHe is also not totally incorrect regarding the status of the Adjmi family who are indeed wealthy and also in real estate.\n\n","byline":"STAFF WRITERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology -

We can get lost in the extremist claims populating mainstream and social media, and put the conflict down to something between men with covered faces, sporting guns.\n\nBut the reality of the situation is that terrified men, women and children have fled their homes across Iraq and Syria, streaming into temporary displacement camps rather than staying to submit to militant control.\n\nThe UN Refugee agency estimates that there are 1 million internally displaced people and 110,000 stateless people in Iraq alone, and the Red Crescent Society pegs over 80 per cent of them as women and young children.\n\nThe amazing pictures you will see below, captured by news photographers in the region, tell a story we will never be able to. Children in temporary displacement camps, children caught by roadside bombs, children scrambling to get food as they enter into the Ramadan period.\n\nThese are the faces of war.\n\n","byline":"Kate Midena ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/news.com.au/Lifestyle/Real Life/","/display/news.com.au/Lifestyle/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/news.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T23:22:26.000Z","description":"THE current situation in Iraq and Syria is undeniably volatile, complicated and dangerous.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28e-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28g-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixwvgh-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28f-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28h-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28d-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"8ad3bf463e1309262855d7949c404f0f","keywords":["displaced Iraqi","temporary displacement","Syrian refugee","Syrian boy","temporary displacement camps","displaced Iraqi girl","autonomous region","sunset communal meal","makeshift hospital","eastern town","car outside","popular market","rebels fighting","Australia","Najaf","Iraq","Syria","United States of America","Baghdadi","Ammar","Bilal Hussein","Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi","Displaced Iraqi boys","Iraqi federal police","temporary camp","temporary shelter","disassembled tent","family rest","Syrian boy looks","society truck","Iraqi children","AFP PHOTO","ruling authority","news photographers","Al Taji","Mosul","Lebanon","Red Crescent Society","Human Rights Watch","UN Refugee agency"],"kicker":"Pictures","link":"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28d-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974107403","originalAssetId":"1226974107403","originalSource":"NewsComAu","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"83d318174984cf5df24c91f6cb40ceb8","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974102805","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"b52c8b513ae3f402d8399636724af3e2","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"c4M25pbjpEZa3nCkN-r-R5Y_IC_ZEwYg","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE terror group proudly publicises its brutal executions and atrocities.

That was a huge challenge,” he said.\n\nInitially the medic was on assignment with the World Health Organisation in Geneva — but when chiefs saw he spoke French and was a critical care doctor they sent him to Guinea.\n\n“There’s a tremendous lack of understanding of this virus, not just in Guinea but around the world,” Dr Fischer says.\n\n“That’s part of the reason the epidemic is ongoing. There a lack of understanding about how it is transmitted.”\n\nEbola virus is spread through the population through human-to-human contact with infected blood, bodily secretions, organs or other bodily fluids.\n\nFAMILIES EAT WITH BODIES IN ROOM\n\nDr Fischer said funeral burial rites, where families wash the bodies of the dead and often eat with them in the same room, played a huge part in transmission of the virus.\n\nHe said often doctors and midwives treating patients at local clinics are carrying the virus and a lack of simple hygiene equipment, such as gloves and masks, aid the transmission.\n\nThe mortality rate among carriers is about 90 per cent.\n\n“(People) have a fear of bringing their loved ones to seek treatment at the facilities because a high number of people don’t come back alive,” he said.\n\n“They are trying to take care of them at home which means there is ongoing transmission of the virus and decreased chances of survival.\n\n“I can understand the reticence to bring them in to a place were they’re more likely to die.”\n\nIn a series of poignant and oftentimes confronting emails home to North Carolina, where he lives with his wife and two sons, Dr Fischer described the daily challenges and the small rays of hope he experienced in Gueckedou.\n\n“Today was a pretty tough day — one of the first two patients I admitted on May 30 died,” he wrote in one dispatch.\n\n‘AS I FINISHED HE DIED’\n\n“I walked into his room and he was on the floor half naked surrounded by bloody emesis and diarrhea. I put him back in bed, bathed him, and put fresh clothes on him and as I finished he died.”\n\n“It’s pretty emotional to bathe a 27-year-old man who was incredibly strong and rendered completely helpless. His sister is next door and will likely die in the next hour.\n\n“This is all in front of the other patients in the room, many of whom are family members or neighbours. The despair is suffocating. My computer is running out of batteries. Sorry, more to come.”\n\nHe also described the “miserable” case of an 18-year-old woman who was five months pregnant and had both Ebola and malaria. He helped deliver her stillborn baby after she began having contractions.\n\nHe said trying to save her from the disease was like “trying to put out a fire with squirt gun.”\n\n“Part of writing the emails allowed my to share thing with my family that I probably wouldn’t have shared with them once I got home,” he told News Corp.\n\n“It’s brutal. It’s tough.”\n\nBut amid the misery Dr Fischer said there was hope to contain the epidemic, despite the locations of the outbreak.\n\n“One of the reasons is the location. Gueckedou is right on the border of Sierra Leone and Guinea. It’s tough to pick a worse place, virus and illness crosses borders easily,” he said.\n\n“The resources and collaboration don’t follow as easily.”\n\nHe said MSF and the WHO were working together with officials from all three countries to improve treatment and prevention.\n\n“It is absolutely controllable — it is not difficult to break the chain of transmission if you have the right resources and people are buying in and participating.”\n\n","byline":"Sarah Millar ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network

He never regained consciousness.\n\nUS agencies are reporting that Bassel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, of Dearborn, Mich, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm.\n\nScott Herkes, a 39-year-old player in the match, said he was about 25 metres away from the action when he saw Bieniewicz punched by a player on the opposing team. He said the referee was looking down at the time and didn’t see the punch coming.\n\n“It was terrifying,” Mr Herkes told US media. “I have never in my life seen something like this”.\n\nMr Herkes went on to say that Saad had been complaining about a call made by the referee prior to his alleged assault. There were reportedly around 30 players at the game and a handful of spectators, many of whom also witnessed the event.\n\nMr Bieniewicz worked as a medical assistant at a children’s hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a small city near Detroit.\n\n“I speak for all his friends when I say we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go out,” James Acho, Bieniewicz’s friend of 30 years, told the Detroit Free Press . “He deserved better.”\n\n“He just absolutely lived it and loved [soccer],” Mr Acho added.\n\nMr Acho said Bieniewicz is being kept on a ventilator until his organs can be harvested and donated through an organisation called Gift of Life. He will leave behind a wife and two young sons.\n\nMr Saad is alleged to have fled the field after the incident and driven away. His attorney, Brian Berry, said his client cooperated with the police investigation and voluntarily turned himself in.\n\n“Mr. Saad is presumed innocent unless and until a fact finder determines differently,” his legal team said in an email to the Detroit Free Press. “As tragic as this event is, we must keep open minds and listen and wait for all the facts of this case to unfold.”\n\n","byline":"STAFF WRITERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network

2014 issue in a high-cut swimsuit, and opened up to the magazine about getting naked on camera.\n\n“It’s a first for me. But Jason [Segel] gets naked, too. It’s just a part of the role. So I did it. I mean you see everything,” she told the mag.\n\nFor a movie called Sex Tape, we’d be surprised if there wasn’t nudity, but her co-star is an old pro when it comes to baring it all on camera. Segel famously did a full-frontal scene for 2007’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a scene which made his mother cry and send out the following email: “I would like to inform you all that Jason has chosen to do full-frontal nudity, however, it is not gratuitous and is essential to the plot.”\n\nBut getting naked wasn’t all Diaz had to do for Sex Tape — there’s also a childbirth scene that sounds like it was a pretty intense experience to film.\n\n“I found myself in a room in the middle of nowhere Massachusetts at 11:00 at night doing a childbirth scene, and everybody’s screaming at one another — Jason, the cameramen, the director,” she told Esquire.\n\n“And me acting like I’m trying to push a basketball out of my vajoon. Crazy sh*t, right? And the thing is, I always take a moment to say, ‘We’re lucky. This is a great job. A fun job’.”\n\nSex Tape hits Australian cinemas on July 31, 2014.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Huffington Post. \n\n","byline":"Stephanie Marcus ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment -

He might well have been saying “g’day Rafa’’.\n\nAfter three hours on the court and more than 37 aces later, having firmly established himself as The Next Big Thing with a shock defeat of the world number one he was saying “Cheerio Rafa’’ with a “juicy wiggle’’ dance celebration.\n\nThe scoreline was an incredible 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 for Kyrgios to set up a quarter-final clash against Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\nFIRSTS: Nick v Nadal by numbers\n\nFAMILY: How mum’s negativity fired up Nick\n\nPRIDE: Kyrgios kicks off Twitter storm with humble post\n\nSo emphatic was the performance, tennis legend John McEnroe remarked: “He’s acting to me like he can win the whole tournament. The last guy that I saw like that was Boris Becker.”\n\nKyrgios turned to his dad George wearing his akubra hat smiling broadly and his sister Halimah in tears in the players’ box and pumped his fist and danced on court to celebrate amid wild roars from the crowd.\n\n“I think I was in a bit of a zone, I didn’t notice the crowd, it hasn’t sunk in,’’ he said, noting modestly, “I played some extraordinary tennis, I was struggling a bit on return, but I got a break in fourth.’’\n\nKyrgios stated the obvious remarking: “I served at a really good level all the way through the match.’’\n\nKyrgios said he had seen an interview given by his mum Norlaila back in Canberra where she had remarked Nadal would be too good for her boy.\n\n“That made me angry, so I don’t know what she is thinking’’, he said smiling. Later when asked what he would say to his mum, he said he would send her a smiley text.\n\nFor the first time since 1982 someone from outside the world 100 had beaten a world number one.\n\nKyrgios started the big game with a ferocity that belied his 19 years, his wildcard status and his inexperience in the senior game. The crowd that filled centre court was initially unsure about this gangly Aussie upstart. How would he handle this pressure cooker atmosphere? As it turned out, the tougher and more critical the point, the more Kyrgios pulled out a blistering serve, a crosscourt backhand winner, or a line-hugging return. Midway during the second set Kyrgios pulled off an instinctive between the legs shot, that ended up being a winner.\n\nKyrgios said: “I think on the big stage, it’s something I thrive on, the atmosphere, the crowd. I just love it when at 5-3, I think it was in the fourth set, they erupted, the crowd. I just love that feeling. At that stage you just think about all the work you put in. You know if you believe in yourself. Especially with my serve, if I just go after it, hit the right spots, I’m going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match like that today.’’\n\nFrom the start he had shocked Nadal and won over the polite crowd. “Aussie’’ yelled one British clipped accent in simple acknowledgment he was witnessing the rapid emergence of a genuine world class contender.\n\nWith his lackadaisical and relaxed manner — clearly undaunted by reputation of the man on the other side of the net — Kyrgios had quickly notched two game points and three set points in the first set. The speed of his play unsettled Nadal who likes his precise routine between points. But the sheer power generated by the 19-year-old saw him bring up an astounding victory.\n\n“Nadal’s wishing Gasquet had put him away a couple of rounds ago, right now,’’ said McEnroe mid-match.\n\nNadal said he had created opportunities but wasn’t able to counter Kyrgios’ big serve. And as he started, Kyrgios closed the epic encounter with another ace.\n\n“Congratulations to him. For me, the beach,’’ said Nadal.\n\nKyrgios will now look to the quarter-finals for his match up against the huge serving Canadian Milos Raonic.\n\n“Have to do it all again tomorrow and I can’t wait! First @Wimbledon & I’m in the last 8 club!!’’, he tweeted later.\n\nHaving played Raonic at Roland Garros last month, Kyrgios, still buzzing from his sensational victory over the world number one Rafael Nadal, was asked about what he could expect when they play in the early hours of tomorrow morning.\n\n“There’s going to be a lot of walking from side to side from his serve, and there’s going to be a lot of winners in the match,\" he said smiling.\n\nRaonic is credited with the biggest serve in the game. At just 23 he is the youngest in the world top ten. But with Kyrgios also regularly firing down serves in excess of 130mph the match will be a peppered-fest of powered aces.\n\n\"It’s going to be hard to find rhythm,\" said Kyrgios. I’m just going to go out there and just go my return of serve. Holding serve is going to be important, being able to make inroads on the other person’s serves.\"\n\nHe admits to being scared of the more illustrious names he is now encountering. Raonic beat him in the first round of the French Open in straight sets.\n\n\"Definitely I’m scared, but I just go through my routine and I just play aggressive,\" he said of his strategy.\n\n\"You know, if they play too good on that point, then it’s too good.\n\n\"But I’m going to go after it and give myself the best chance to win the point.\"\n\nRaonic, who like Kyrgios has been notching up in excess of 30 aces a match said his serve gives him a bit of freedom on the return.\n\nThe winner of the match will probably face the in-form Swiss legend Roger Federer in the semifinals.\n\n","byline":"Jacquelin Magnay in London ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T19:53:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T00:04:35.000Z","description":"AND it started with an ace.

It was widely viewed as the crowning achievement of a long and illustrious career.\n\nThe Queen had given Harris a CBE in 2006, a year after the ­entertainer had painted her portrait as a special 80th birthday gift to the nation.\n\nWhat the monarch didn’t know was that her protection staff had been warned at the time she sat for the portrait that Harris was ­accused of assaulting a young girl.\n\n“He ruined my life,’’ the letter warned. “You need to know what kind of man you’ve let near the Queen.’’\n\nEven if she had been aware, however, the Queen, like all Britons, would likely have discounted the claims as sheer nonsense, such was the exalted, irreproachable reputation of cuddly, quirky Harris. That reputation now counts for nought. Harris will forever more be remembered as a serial abuser and chronic liar who has wrecked countless lives.\n\nAfter several days of deliberation, the jury of six women and six men on Monday decided that Harris, now 84, and a much diminished version of that ebullient favoured performer of royalty, was indeed a sinister pervert who had a demon lurking beneath the charming exterior. The jury had discovered that each stroke of evidence, even bits that were vague or unclear, could be pieced together to identify what was happening, just like one of Harris’ showman lines: “Can you guess what it is yet?’’\n\nIndeed, as woman after woman told of their abuse at the hands of Harris, the extent of his predatory behaviour became clear.\n\nTellingly, Harris had close links to Britain’s most prolific pedophile Jimmy Savile. It can now be reported that Harris and Savile, who were colleagues and two of the BBC’s most visible celebrities, embarked on an out-of-hours evening visit to the high-security Broadmoor psychiatric hospital in 1973. Savile, who had his own keys to the establishment, took Harris to the punishment ward at precisely the time the patients were stripped naked before going to bed. One patient recalled Harris performing an impromptu Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport during his visit.\n\nHarris may have believed that his arrogant molestation of young girls was adequately masked behind his genial, bear-hug persona and he was safe from discovery throughout the decades. Perhaps he was emboldened because his sudden predatory actions so shocked his victims — more so with people nearby, and with his insouciant attitude afterwards — no one would believe them.\n\nBut Harris’s downfall came about because all of his victims before the court had told a confidant: either a school friend, medical staffer, doctor, husband, brother, father or counsellor many years earlier about their ugly encounters with the “dirty old man Rolf ­Harris’’, “the kiddie fiddler’’, the “octopus’’. As innocuous as some remarks may have been at the time, this very contemporaneous outpouring about assaults in confidence to others, many decades before it was to be significant, helped nail Harris. It was a tactic the police and prosecution were keenly conscious of — and other complaints that did not have this back-up evidence were put to one side.\n\nNone of this would have come to light if not for Harris’s performance at the royal Diamond Jubilee Concert in London on that June 2012 evening.\n\nNearly 180km to the north of the capital, a 47-year-old woman watching that event at a family party suddenly erupted in a flood of tears when Harris appeared. This tearful, middle-aged woman finally felt strong enough, following years of alcoholic rehabilitation, to complain to Scotland Yard, some eight years after first detailing the abuse to doctors.\n\nThe catalyst was simple: she couldn’t bear seeing Harris any more on the television. “I thought I can’t get away from this bloody man,’’ she said. Without her initiative, it is unlikely Harris would have had his day in court.\n\nAt the time, Harris was enjoying the fruits of half a century of adoration in his adopted country, presenting a television show Animal Hospital, receiving another award from the Queen — an Order of Australia — and arriving at Australia House in The Strand for a reception in ugg boots.\n\nThe timing of the complaint by the woman, who can’t be named for legal reasons but was identified in court as the childhood friend of Bindi, Harris’s daughter, was particularly critical. Two months earlier, in October 2012, Operation Yewtree had been established to investigate historic sex claims, following the unmasking of Savile.\n\nSavile had a sleazy, uncomfortable demeanour but had escaped investigation, despite isolated complaints throughout the decades, because of his celebrity status, and disjointed policing in different boroughs.\n\nOperation Yewtree also investigated a hotline of complaints against a celebrity roll call: Stuart Hall, Max Clifford, Bill Roache, David Lee Travis and Gary Glitter, with mixed results.\n\nHarris was so fearful when he went to see Scotland Yard nine days after the woman had given nearly three hours of evidence, he refused to answer any questions on the advice of his solicitor.\n\nInstead Harris composed a statement, which the police received several days later, explaining he knew the woman, and they had had consensual sexual activity on two occasions. He later admitted he had not revealed another half a dozen sex acts because he was embarrassed revealing such details in front of “two lovely ladies’’ in the solicitors’ office.\n\nBut Bindi’s childhood friend had told a variety of people in 1996 about Harris and it was never in terms of a consensual relationship, but rather child abuse from the age of 13 starting on a Harris holiday to Hawaii and Australia. Her parents, brothers and four different medical personnel, and critically Bindi herself and Bindi’s then boyfriend Malcolm Cox were all informed with immediate consequences. Cox didn’t want Harris anywhere near his and Bindi’s baby son, and their relationship folded.\n\nSuch was Bindi’s distress at the discovery of this abuse, she tried to stab herself with forks and furiously confronted her father. His response? “I’m sorry, love.’’\n\nPolice continued their investigations and Harris continued to stonewall, hoping it would all go away. So secretive was he about the trouble, his brother and manager Bruce wouldn’t find out until watching one of the complainants, Tonya Lee, on A Current Affair 18 months later.\n\nThree months after this first questioning under caution, police had obtained from the woman’s mother the infamous letter in which Harris revealed his self-loathing and said he was sickened by what he had done to her.\n\nOn March 24 last year he was called to the police station again. As was his right, he refused any questions, but submitted in writing a statement revealing he had had sex with the woman three or four times. This time the rumours were in overload and The Sun splashed on its front page in the middle of April last year that it was Harris — the children’s entertainer and much loved public figure — who was being questioned about sex allegations.\n\nThe public response was immediate. In New Zealand a woman who had been assaulted by Harris on the dance floor when she was 16 said to her husband “they finally got the bastard”. Over the next few months more and more women got in touch with Scotland Yard, including six whose accounts were vital in providing further bad character evidence against Harris. A further five were not allowed in evidence by the judge. None of them knew the other, yet their interactions with Harris were all tawdry and despite the passage of decades, they were still emotionally affected by the incidents.\n\nA woman in Malta described how she had been “happy’’ that Harris had finished intimately molesting her because she had feared he was planning to rape her.\n\nThere was the makeup lady from Channel Seven who was consistently groped; the Darwin woman who had been given her first tongue-kiss by Harris; Australian actor Tony Porter who witnessed Harris fondling another makeup woman; and a mother and daughter in Hamilton, near Newcastle, who were assaulted during a British Paints promotion.\n\nLast night, Lee, who was assaulted by Harris when she was a 14-year-old on a trip to London with a theatre group and is the only victim of Harris who has waived her right to anonymity, told A Current Affair the entertainer had ruined her life.\n\n“Everyone thought that Rolf was just this great person,” she said. “He wasn’t. He was a pedophile. I hate that he’s ruined my life and he doesn’t even acknowledge it. He doesn’t even remember me — that’s what he told the court. Can you believe that?”\n\nIn the midst of his legal nightmare last year, Harris ran on stage at the Bristol Hippodrome, still the quirky entertainer singing Court of King Caractacus, Jake The Peg, his famous covers of Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven, Delilah by Tom Jones and a rousing Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport — to the memorable tune of Land of Hope and Glory.\n\nHarris’s humiliation and the public downfall of his private life have now stained his much-loved public performances. No longer the much-loved children’s entertainer, Harris is now the convicted pedophile who had preyed upon unsuspecting young girls.\n\nFrom a televised blue-blood engagement such a short time ago, the final memory of Harris is a few bars of Jake The Peg, sung in desperation under the stark fluorescent lights of a dingy 1970s courtroom in Southwark, just metres from the Tower of London and in front of a bewildered jury.\n\n","byline":"Jacquelin Magnay ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The

The evidence has been plentiful for some years and continues to mount. The origins of the crisis are deep-seated. This is the reason it is unlikely to be easily reversed. The nation’s economic advantages are extensive but unless buttressed by effective public policy they will erode relentlessly.\n\nThe troubles of the Rudd-Gillard era, usually attributed to their fierce leadership rivalry, can only be grasped in the context of the malaise within the political system. The omens suggest this might only deepen under the Abbott prime ministership.\n\nThe erosion in Australia’s political culture over a decade is alarming. It is tied to wider social and media trends. That many Western democracies are at a more advanced stage of this malaise — defined as the inability of political systems to respond to the needs of their societies — is no cause for assurance.\n\nIndeed, the global evidence only raises a troubling question: is this the new norm? The former Labor government was broken by the pressures of the system. Labor under both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, despite their achievements, was not able to hold the line on sustainable policy delivery.\n\nThe institutional question arising from Tony Abbott’s policies is whether a reforming prime minister can succeed any more in this country given the decisive shift in the system and culture against reform. The last three prime ministers were destroyed over management of their reform agendas: John Howard on Work Choices, Rudd and Gillard on a mix of climate change, mining tax and fiscal policy.\n\nIt is true these leaders made serious mistakes. It is equally true they faced a transformed political environment that made reform much tougher. The historical record of the Hawke-Keating era is rightly lauded. But it is by no means clear that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating would succeed in today’s system.\n\nAny nation that has lost the art of collective self-improvement has stepped on to the escalator of decline. Australia is on that escalator. Its politics are so noisy, egotistical, destructive and consumed by self-interest that it has missed where the escalator is heading.\n\nIn voting terms it is far harder than before to construct and hold together a majority for reform. ­Laments about the decline of bipartisanship are ancient history. Bipartisanship faded away in the early Howard years, think 1996-97.\n\nBut the Liberal-Labor gulf over the nation’s direction has widened recently and now involves division over climate change, budget policy, industrial relations, tax reform, welfare entitlements, pensions, Medicare, university fees, competition and productivity. Agreement over the national direction is being torn apart.\n\nThe incentives in the system reward and promote policy division. Such splits are not just ideological; they are tactical. Australia is dominated by a poll-driven political culture. It privileges sectional interests over the national interest, short-term actions and the power of the negative.\n\nRecent history is defined by the triumph of the negative and fatal blunders on the part of agents for changes, witness the ACTU campaign against Work Choices, the mining industry campaign against the mining tax, the Abbott-led destruction of carbon pricing and, most recently, the undermining of the Abbott-Hockey budget on the crusade of fairness.\n\nLabor, convinced it was destroyed in office by Abbott’s unjustified negativity and unable to accept it was undone primarily by its own blunders, now exploits a tough and unpopular budget to inflict the same treatment on Abbott.\n\nIt is no surprise that 22 years of unbroken economic growth have exerted a profound impact on our political culture. Its corruption is advanced though how far is yet to be tested. It is defined by two qualities: complacency and expectations that cannot be financed by the tax base.\n\nIndeed, legislated programs cannot be financed by the tax base as the current and former Treasury secretaries have warned. Yet much of the political system insists Australia has no budgetary problem. It says the harsh medicine being handed out is unnecessary because the problem has been fabricated. This reveals an immaturity in public debate the nation was supposed to have left behind decades ago.\n\nThere are many manifestations: a culture of complaint, the decline of self-reliance, the belief that virtually any hardship is the fault of government and a political system that bids for votes by promising that government will solve even more problems.\n\nThe irony of modern government is apparent: it cannot deliver the product on time as promised, making people even more unhappy. The state is overloaded. This was basic in undermining Rudd where the gulf between his promises and delivery became a huge liability.\n\nThe prosperity generated by the decade-long China boom has seen a decline in public interest policy, the rise of a more self-interested culture and a retreat in informed opinion about the reasons for Australia’s past success and the need for another round of national interest reform.\n\nThe trust between the political system and the people to sustain ambitious policy may now be severed. If so, Australia faces an unhappy deterioration from its recent highs.\n\nFragmentation is the story of the times. Labor has lost a large segment of voters to the Greens. Abbott faces the prospect of being undermined by Clive Palmer, Australia’s version of a populist Berlusconi. Disillusionment in the community may be matched by deadlock in the parliament.\n\nThe fragmentation of the media marketplace fits into this process. Technology and campaign techniques mean disaffected voters from any government or opposition policy can be targeted and won.\n\nCreating losers is more high risk than before. The decline of mass media and rise of social media weakens the ability of leaders to carry opinion and shifts media power downwards.\n\nDuring the reform age, roughly 1983 to 2003, the media was pivotal in backing national interest policies but that age is passing. It is replaced by new media values that mirror the fashionable narcissism and find national interest debates as quaint and irrelevant.\n\nAustralia’s prosperity is living on borrowed time, courtesy of past reforms and the China boom. There is a silly, contested debate about whether Australia faces an economic crisis. There is no doubt, however, that Australia is undergoing a crisis of its political system.\n\n","byline":"PAUL KELLY ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/Paul Kelly/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Opinion/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/opinion/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T13:33:43.000Z","description":"THE trajectory of Australia’s relative decline now seems set with the nation in denial of its economic challenges and suffering a malaise in its political decision-making — signalling that a country that cannot recognise its problems is far from finding their solution.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/politics-in-crisis-and-a-nation-in-denial/story-e6frg74x-1226974255262?sv=a235dfc984f88a5cfbc5838e5ebdf203","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"38041bc9a0ade5e99ce201fb6f107447","keywords":["political system","national interest","national interest reform","political culture","national interest debates","climate change","sectional interests","PAUL KELLY","transformed political environment","national interest policies","interest policy","political decision-making","sustainable policy delivery","relative decline","national direction","poll-driven political culture","contested debate","industrial relations","fiscal policy","political systems","institutional question","historical record","opposition policy","self-interested culture","policy division","troubling question","carbon pricing","voting terms","unhappy deterioration","short-term actions","ambitious policy","public policy","prime ministership","economic challenges","mining tax","economic advantages","fatal blunders","welfare entitlements","fierce leadership rivalry","unjustified negativity","social media","China","Julia Gillard","Paul Keating","Kevin Rudd","Tony Abbott","Bob Hawke","Hawke-Keating"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/politics-in-crisis-and-a-nation-in-denial/story-e6frg74x-1226974255262?sv=a235dfc984f88a5cfbc5838e5ebdf203","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974255262","originalAssetId":"1226974255262","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Opinion/Columnists/Paul Kelly/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","related":[],"standFirst":"OUR political culture is noisy, egotistical, destructive and consumed by self-interest.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE trajectory of Australia’s relative decline now seems set with the nation in denial of its economic challenges and suffering a malaise in its political decision-making — signalling that a country that cannot recognise its problems is far from finding their solution.\n\n","subtitle":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["kordinaj"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial\n","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"b92fc5b0-00fb-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Paul Kelly"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226974256214?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974256214","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974256188","subtitle":"b92fc5b0-00fb-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d","title":"Politics in crisis and a nation in denial\n","width":100},"title":"Politics in crisis, nation in denial"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":["Paige Taylor"],"body":"A senior Sri Lankan navy official said a naval vessel departed yesterday following several days of talks with Australian authorities about how to handle the impending asylum-seeker arrivals — which would have been the first to reach Australian territory in six months. “What I know is that one of our ships has already sailed.

But the far more dangerous operation planned for late this week or early next week in the monsoonal Indian Ocean will be only the second time such a handover has taken place in as many years.\n\nIn July 2012, The Australian was on board the SLNS Samudura when it met a French supertanker, Euronav, for an ocean transfer of 28 Sri Lankans. The Euronav had been convinced by Australian authorities to rescue the asylum seekers and divert to Sri Lankan waters to meet the Samudura.\n\nThough all 28 asylum-seekers, including four women and one child, were transferred safely, the operation ended with a sickening collision between the two vessels after monsoonal swells forced the far smaller Samudura back into the side of the 330-metre supertanker.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott announced last October on the sidelines of the Colombo-hosted Commonwealth Heads of Australian Governments Meeting (CHOGM) that Australia would donate two retired Australian Bay Class coastguard vessels to Sri Lanka to help its navy and coast guard prevent asylum-seekers leaving its shores.\n\nThe 10-year-old boats were refitted at a cost of more than $2 million.\n\nBut The Australian understands neither of the Bay Class vessels are suitable for\n\nmonsoonal ocean waters, and the same SLNS Samudura has been deployed for the\n\nimpending ocean transfer.\n\nThe move to transfer the asylum-seekers to Sri Lankan custody is a blatant violation\n\nof Australia’s commitments to the UN refugee convention, which acknowledges a\n\nright of protection for refugees who have a reasonable fear of persecution if returned\n\nto their home country.\n\nAdditional reporting: Rosie Lewis\n\n","byline":"Amanda Hodge ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Immigration/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T07:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T07:31:01.000Z","description":"A BOATLOAD of Sri Lankan asylum-seekers found near Cocos Island has been picked up by Australian authorities and will be handed over to the Sri Lankan navy, an official navy spokesman has confirmed.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/sri-lanka-warns-of-dangers-in-midocean-asylumseeker-transfer/story-fn9hm1gu-1226975328157?sv=f0072136247e74e3c162392695d242d6","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"3479b3fc184a61052352775a88add60f","keywords":["Australian authorities","ocean transfer","navy commanders","naval vessel","asylum seekers","navy official","transfer operation","coastguard vessels","refugee convention","border protection","home country","Sri Lanka","United Nations Organization","Joint Agency","Australian Border Protection Services","Tony Abbott","Scott Morrison","Australian civilian vessel","mid-ocean asylum-seeker transfer","monsoonal ocean waters","official navy spokesman","impending asylum-seeker arrivals","mid-ocean transfers","Australian vessel","Australian territory","Indonesian authorities","Christmas Island","Australia","Amanda Hodge"],"kicker":"Exclusive","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/sri-lanka-warns-of-dangers-in-midocean-asylumseeker-transfer/story-fn9hm1gu-1226975328157?sv=f0072136247e74e3c162392695d242d6","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975328157","originalAssetId":"1226975328157","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Immigration/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"3cdd0bbf6a649b63f0b81c3144f87811","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975328105","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A BOATLOAD of asylum-seekers found near Cocos Island has been picked up by Australian authorities and will be handed to Sri Lanka’s navy.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"A BOATLOAD of Sri Lankan asylum-seekers found near Cocos Island has been picked up by Australian authorities and will be handed over to the Sri Lankan navy, an official navy spokesman has confirmed. \n\nA second senior Sri Lankan navy official told The Australian the asylum-seekers, picked up on a separate boat from that believed to have left southern India in mid-June, would be transferred to a Sri Lankan naval vessel in mid-ocean, in rough seas whipped up the monsoon.\n\n","subtitle":"Sri Lanka warns of dangers in mid-ocean asylum-seeker transfer ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Rough seas threat to boat transfer ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"f4904752-01a9-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

I can’t say what my final position will be,” he said.\n\nThe Australian was told yesterday that Victorian Senator Ricky Muir, from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, also has concerns about the Newstart changes.\n\n“We’re still to be briefed on the government’s policies so it’s not possible to give definitive answers on what he will support,” said Senator Muir’s adviser Glenn Druery.\n\n“But he has expressed concerns about the issue privately.”\n\nMr Abbott told his cabinet colleagues yesterday that he was “reasonably optimistic” of getting a good outcome with the new Senate.\n\n“I think we can all be very confident that the deal that we struck with the Australian people in the election campaign is being delivered upon so, well done,” he told them.\n\nThe Newstart change is one of the key reforms in social services bills that outline more than $12bn in savings over four years — most of them to be stymied or vetoed by Labor, the Greens and those on the crossbench.\n\nThe reform is due to start in January and will require those aged under 30 to wait up to six months before they receive Newstart, although the waiting period is shorter for those with many years of work behind them.\n\nThose who go back to school or start vocational education will avoid the six-month waiting period.\n\nGreens families spokeswoman Rachel Siewert said the idea was a “cruel policy” to impose severe hardship on some of the 550,000 applications for emergency relief forecast over the next four years.\n\nIntensifying the debate over youth unemployment, the Abbott government began its Work for the Dole scheme yesterday in 18 trial sites around Australia to prepare for a national rollout from July next year.\n\nSenator Day also expressed concern at the idea of forcing young Australians to work for nothing,\n\n“No-one’s going in to bat for the jobless youth. We’re destroying a generation,” he said, arguing that young workers should be given the right to waive the workplace laws if it got them a job.\n\n“All you have to do is allow people to opt-out of if they want to,” he said.\n\n“If you don’t want to, you shouldn’t be forced to stay in the system and therefore stay unemployed.”\n\nSenator Day said he had no qualms about blocking the $1.2bn saving on the Newstart change in order to make the case for industrial relations reform. “There’s no contest — it’s a no-brainer,” he said.\n\n","byline":"DAVID CROWE ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T16:14:17.000Z","description":"A NEW fight is looming on the federal government’s welfare reforms as incoming Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits for the young, shooting down another key budget saving.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/new-senate-threat-to-federal-governments-welfare-reforms/story-fn59nsif-1226974431977?sv=a0e87e2762b9f4abf541550ea190986c","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"666ff4d5278ba41fde8d7ccf8c6b41f5","keywords":["welfare reforms","young people","penalty rates","workplace reform","social services","workplace laws","waiting period","conservative parties","key budget","unemployment benefits","federal government","emergency relief","key reforms","national rollout","start vocational education","definitive answers","expressed concerns","Australian people","jobless rules","budget agenda","unfair dismissal laws","Australia","Parliament House","Bob Day","David Leyon","industrial relations reform","incoming senators","tackle workplace reform","Greens families spokeswoman","workplace reforms","welfare plans","key budget saving","young workers","trial sites","final position","youth unemployment","government tackle","Liberal Party","Kevin Andrews","Tony Abbott","Glenn Druery","Ricky Muir","Rachel Siewert"],"kicker":"EXCLUSIVE","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/new-senate-threat-to-federal-governments-welfare-reforms/story-fn59nsif-1226974431977?sv=a0e87e2762b9f4abf541550ea190986c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974431977","originalAssetId":"1226974431977","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"74b92113e0ecd4ea430b0eb9ae6ffa0f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974426951","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"13dbc239139ca681d27e41218bce152e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974297422","referenceType":"SECONDARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A FIGHT is looming on the government’s welfare reforms as new Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"A NEW fight is looming on the federal government’s welfare reforms as incoming Senators reject plans to cut unemployment benefits for the young, shooting down another key budget saving. \n\nThe plan to force young Australians to “earn or learn” is heading for defeat as micro conservative parties demand the government tackle workplace reform rather than punish those who cannot find jobs.\n\n","subtitle":"New Senate threat to federal government’s welfare reforms","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Kym Smith"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"New Senate threat to welfare reforms","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"77a03fcc-00cd-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

The last guy that I saw like that was Boris Becker,” he told the BBC.\n\nAs fantastical the angles were that McEnroe created on a court and as shrill as his challenging of officials was, the American is not prone to hyperbole when rating talent, which makes the praise headier.\n\n“John McEnroe, who has a great understanding of the game and is an accurate assessment of talent, says he is the next big thing and that he hasn’t seen a kid like him in many, many years and he believes he could win the tournament,” Tiley said.\n\nOther Australian greats revelled in Kyrgios’ ability to retain composure against the formidable Nadal.\n\nJohn Newcombe was stunned that the 19-year-old, who faces Canadian Milos Raonic in a quarter-final tonight, was able to maintain his composure and concentration.\n\nParticularly impressive, Newcombe said, was that Kyrgios was able to stay with Nadal when the Spanish champion also served at an extremely high level.\n\nPaul McNamee described it as the day Australian tennis irrevocably changed.\n\nIt is all high praise for the Canberra teen who began his tennis career as a little ball boy, fetching after his older brother.\n\nTiley was renowned as a coach in South Africa and in the US College system before moving to Australia to take charge of our junior programs.\n\nHe has since been tasked with running the sport as a whole in Australia but his views are widely respected by stars including Nadal and Roger Federer, who called on Kyrgios as a practice partner leading into the French Open.\n\nTiley believes that Kyrgios is the type of player who will draw children to tennis.\n\n“He is fearless. He stands up to pressure. He has a good team around him of really good coaches and the entire Australian contingent,” he told SEN Radio.\n\n“He is someone that is exciting to watch. He has a big serve, a big game, he loves being out there and competes hard and we have just watched it here at Wimbledon. He walks around and has a natural attraction to all the young kids.\n\n“I think he is going to bring a lot of kids to our sport. I know we have the World Cup going on right now but there is far more exciting things, we think, in Australian sport watching our young players do well at Wimbledon.”\n\nKyrgios’ opponent also praised the young giant-slayer, but he hedged his bets as to whether he could he would become the next big star.\n\n“For me is very easy to say he can be top 10. I think he can do. Is not an issue that I think he cannot do it,’’ said Nadal. “But when we see a young player that arrives to the tour and plays a great match or plays a great tournament, people say he will be the next big star.\n\n“Some things are right — sometimes arrive, sometimes not. So depends how the things improve over the next couple of months, years, for him. So if he is able to keep improving, he will be. If not, will be more difficult.’’\n\n","byline":"Courtney Walsh ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T03:13:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:33:16.000Z","description":"IN the hours after Nick Kyrgios stunned Rafael Nadal, the ageing members of Australia’s golden generation of players were marvelling at the success of a young man destined for greater wins.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-likened-to-boris-becker-by-giants-of-tennis/story-fnbe6xeb-1226975092761?sv=5268eb332e697d9316fdfa8cc2f39623","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"b539c8c9c94d259f2b6a288da89ef336","keywords":["global headlines","news outlets","day Australian tennis","tennis career","Australian greats","Nick v","natural attraction","young giant-slayer","South Africa","London","United Kingdom","Australia","All England Club","John Mcenroe","Rafael Nadal","John Newcombe","Neale Fraser","Kenny Rosewall","Rod Laver","ball boy","Australian teenager","between-the-legs winner","practice partner","autobiography signing","things improve","commentary box","Australian contingent","Australian sport","United States of America College","British Broadcasting Corporation","Roger Federer","Craig Tiley","Boris Becker","Paul McNamee","Ken Rosewall","Courtney Walsh","Ashley Cooper","Fred Stolle"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-likened-to-boris-becker-by-giants-of-tennis/story-fnbe6xeb-1226975092761?sv=5268eb332e697d9316fdfa8cc2f39623","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975092761","originalAssetId":"1226975092761","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"c72c213c46693d2d11089ce0b6492edd","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"N0b2Jtbjpe0vna-e516tQ5Gm-Og_dac4","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"caadd2d5f052005c7907cc069f3e29a3","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"VwZzVtbjrTtJejX6X6tcl8QNrvZdFa27","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"63ec7fedd8c684ba6c3e1e95fc56b377","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975092735","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE_GALLERY","id":"8c7cdadf35f07d6bfb49205b353aeb6f","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974962981","referenceType":"SECONDARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"4791fbcdabd589cd14d842cb8c24e277","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974722843","referenceType":"SECONDARY"},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":"3255e293809c8ad13ec7d3119820c689","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974527033","referenceType":"SECONDARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE giants of tennis, including John McEnroe, have said Nick Kyrgios is acting like he can win the tournament.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"IN the hours after Nick Kyrgios stunned Rafael Nadal, the ageing members of Australia’s golden generation of players were marvelling at the success of a young man destined for greater wins. \n\nKen Rosewall, considered one of the finest players never to win Wimbledon, has been at the All England Club for an autobiography signing.\n\n","subtitle":"Nick Kyrgios likened to Boris Becker by giants of tennis","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"ebcc194e-018a-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["aussie tennis palyer","brothers ball boy","brothers","tennis","palyer"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226975206212?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975206212","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226975206184","subtitle":"ebcc194e-018a-11e4-8fce-3dc9660cd2ac","title":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’","width":100},"title":"From ball boy to ‘the next Becker’"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"While this may sound uncharitable, baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) and their cousins loudly resist any moves to crimp their lifestyle, content to leave it to future generations to pick up the tab.

He told us: “Australia is pretty much at the best point — the sweet spot — in the demographic transition, now.”\n\nHe predicted: “After 2010, the depen­dency ratio — the ratio between children and older people of working age — is expected to increase more rapidly as baby boomers reach pension age.”\n\nHow right he was. Since 2010, we have lost the equivalent of 200,000 mainly baby boomers, from the workforce. Another 250,000 are expected to retire between now and 2025. The impact of these retirements will be a growing headwind to future growth as it bears down on productivity. As Costello said: “Demography is destiny.” Armed with the intergenerational report, the Howard government set out to protect the interests of future generations by minimising the inevitable economic pressures it foresaw building beyond 2010.\n\nIt cleared the national debt and established the Future Fund to meet the growing pension claims of public servants. Contemporary taxpayers were required to contribute their share of future liabilities. Costello was looking 40 years into the future and beyond the forward estimates.\n\nThe Abbott government similarly is seized with the challenges posed by our demographics. Policies such as paid parental leave, the raising of the pensionable age to 70 for those under 50 and providing incentives for the employment of eligible workers over 50 are all directed at keeping as many people in the workforce as possible to boost productivity. In attempting to bring the budget into balance, the government is exercising a duty of care to future generations. But it is a lonely position.\n\nUnfortunately for the Abbott government, its policy options are limited. Gone is the budget surplus. Public debt stands at 30 per cent of GDP and is rising rapidly. Many of the Howard and Labor government concessions and supplements are no longer affordable.\n\nDemographic change is working against fiscal balance with escalating claims from an ageing population having to be met by a shrinking number of taxpayers in more uncertain economic times.\n\nInaction means government spending outstripping revenue when our terms of trade are falling and are expected to fall for another decade. Our labour and energy costs are among the world’s highest; productivity growth is weak and our global competitiveness is sliding.\n\nIt is clear that unless Australia takes stock of these developments, our fiscal situation must deteriorate further.\n\nYet there is collective opposition to attempts to remedy this, and a refusal to pay as you go. By definition it will fall to future generations to shoulder the burden. Where is the fairness in that?\n\nBy design or default, it is socially destructive to pit generations against each other. Take for example our 17 to 24-year-olds, 27 per cent of whom are not in full-time work or full-time study. Their poor education has left them exposed. Even those who seek part-time employment are likely to be denied because of unrealistic award structures. Inevitable feelings of alienation are what have led to the social unrest we have witnessed in Europe and Britain.\n\nIn his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Edmund Burke wrote that the real social contract is the partnership between the generations, “not only between those who are living but between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are to be born”.\n\nThe experience of the 17 to 24- year-olds suggests that contract is at risk. The young are outnumbered. Baby boomers already exceed the under-15s as a percentage of the population.\n\nEven assuming those voting for the first time would support fiscal balance — unlikely given the culture in which they have been raised — polls suggest they would be easily outvoted.\n\nSo, without urgent action, future generations seem destined to become critical of a system that allowed the profligacy and selfishness of previous generations to limit their opportunities.\n\nWith the present mix of macro and micro settings, our fiscal imbalances won’t fix themselves. We may pretend we’ll restore balance tomorrow when a “fairer” budget can be found, but realistically we know that day will never come because the longer we wait, the greater the sacrifices needed.\n\nAnd why not criticise the Coalition for being ham-fisted at selling the budget? It may be cynical but, if it derails the budget, as a political exercise it makes sense. The more the fiscal position deteriorates, the more the government will be blamed.\n\nWhile it may not be perfect, the Hockey budget is a sensible trade-off between recurrent spending and long-term investment and between structural balance and growth.\n\nIt is also the only budget on the table. Much is riding on it passing. Not least, a harmonious society and the future prosperity and social mobility of our young.\n\nNothing could be more equitable than that.\n\nMaurice Newman is chairman of the government’s Business Advisory Council.

Court documents show the money was paid to two entities — Media Circus ­Network, a media agency involved in Mr Palmer’s costly federal ­election campaign, and Cosmo Developments.\n\nMr Palmer denies any wrongdoing. But the seriousness of the matters means they are likely to be referred to police.\n\nRecords show that, after 14 years as a director, Mr Palmer resigned from Cosmo Developments in late May, a fortnight after it was first revealed in The Australian that Mineralogy had been ­accused in the Federal Court in Perth of wrongfully siphoning $10m in August last year and a further $2.167m just days before the September 7 federal election.\n\nAustralian Securities & Investments Commission records show Mr Palmer ended his role at Cosmo Developments on May 25, the same day his nephew, Clive Mensink, joined as sole director of the company, having been ­appointed the company secretary in May last year. Mr Mensink, the head of ore supply at the resources tycoon’s Queensland Nickel refin­ery in Townsville, did not return The Australian’s call yesterday.\n\nHowever, other documentary records show Mr Palmer’s resignation as a director of Cosmo Devel­opments was not detected publicly because it was omitted from his May 27 update of a federal parliament “register of members’ interests”.\n\nIn this May 27 update, which bears a May 29 stamp from the parliamentary registry, Mr Palmer disclosed that he had resigned as a director of the four most prominent and significant companies in his business group — Mineralogy, QNI Metals, QNI Resources and Queensland Nickel. There was no mention of Cosmo Developments.\n\nAsked by The Australian yesterday if he had resigned from Cosmo Developments to distance himself from the $10m in Chinese funds that went into the company from the NAB cheque account, Mr Palmer did not respond. He did not reply to a question about why his May 27 update to parliament did not disclose his resignation from Cosmo Developments.\n\nHowever, Mr Palmer issued a tweet in which he said that The Australian was a “real threat to democracy”.\n\n“I’ll be commencing defamation action against Hedley Thomas over latest erroneous smear,’’ tweeted Mr Palmer, who already has ongoing defamation proceedings against this reporter, The Australian, the Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and his Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney.\n\nMr Palmer, Mr Mensink and others have been warned in subpoenas and legal orders that they face arrest if they do not hand over certain documents and ­information.\n\nMedia Circus is understood to have been subcontracted by ­another Brisbane advertising agency, Coroneo, which worked directly for Mr Palmer.\n\nOver the past three years, the Bank of China, on behalf of the government of China, has deposited more than $23m, including the $12.167m, that went missing.\n\nLawyers for Citic Pacific claim the money withdrawn from the ­account, which Mr Palmer controlled, could not have been legitimately spent on what he has described as “port management services”. This is because the amounts withdrawn were “exorbitant”, according to Citic Pacific, and Mineralogy was not operating the port.\n\nMedia Circus Network’s role and expertise in helping clients build brands and profile through advertising campaigns has nothing to do with the management of a remote iron ore port.\n\nMr Palmer denied he used Chinese government money to help pay for his campaign, claiming it was a “complete untruth”.\n\nTony Abbott said: “That’s a matter between Mr Palmer and the people who are claiming there is an issue.\n\n“Obviously, there is a dispute on and let’s see how that gets ­resolved,” the Prime Minister said.\n\n","byline":"Hedley Thomas and Rosie Lewis ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/business/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T10:51:53.000Z","description":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments, which had received $10 million of ­Chinese funds allegedly wrong­fully siphoned from a National Australia Bank account, are being forensically examined amid a quasi-judicial probe into the missing cash.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/probe-into-clive-palmers-missing-12m-widens/story-e6frg8zx-1226974297124?sv=b53936beee0d02d18877e401a8e895b3","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"f181c84c97b9a951e22dde1246fdd2fb","keywords":["federal election campaign","iron ore port","federal eelction campaign","ongoing defamation proceedings","express contractual purpose","Chinese government money","Supreme Court","Bank of China Limited","Federal Court","Citic Pacific Ltd.","National Australia Bank Limited","Queensland Nickel","iron ore","federal election","Chinese funds","Rosie Lewis","confidential arbitration proceedings","Chinese state-owned company","defamation action","investigation process","remote iron ore","federal parliament","port management services","reasonable expenses","cheque account","Western Australia","Australia","Perth","China","Queensland","Brisbane","Tony Abbott","Richard Chesterman","Jeff Seeney","Campbell Newman","Palmer","Hedley Thomas"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/probe-into-clive-palmers-missing-12m-widens/story-e6frg8zx-1226974297124?sv=b53936beee0d02d18877e401a8e895b3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974297124","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Business/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","related":[],"standFirst":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments are being investigated.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE actions of a once-obscure Clive Palmer-controlled company called Cosmo Developments, which received $10 million of Chinese funds allegedly wrongfully siphoned from a National Australia Bank account, are being forensically examined amid a quasi-judicial probe into the missing cash. \n\nThe ultimate destination of the cash from the $10m cheque, No. 2046, which was drawn on the NAB account on August 8, is now a major part of a rapidly escalating investigation process being conducted in confidential arbitration proceedings led by a retired Supreme Court judge, Richard Chesterman, QC.\n\n","subtitle":"Probe into Clive Palmer’s missing $12m widens","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Glenn Barnes"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Probe into Palmer’s missing $12m widens","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6292cc18-00ea-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d -

The analysis shows that high childcare fees discourage parents from working more than three days a week.\n\nThe Productivity Commission also argues that before and after-school-hours care should not be subjected to the requirement in the national quality framework for qualified educators to be included in all childcare settings.\n\nThe report is understood to back strongly 15 hours a week of preschool for four-year-olds, a proposal that would require increased government funding. The federal government has not funded its component of the preschool funding agreement with the states beyond its conclusion in December, prompting the states to claim they will reduce the number of hours of preschool they fund.\n\nThe report says the centre-based childcare system is most beneficial for children who are disadvantaged, and urges that the system needing to target “at risk” children who benefit enormously from formal long daycare.\n\nThe report will also discuss the new paid parental leave scheme — capped now at $100,000 per mother for six months of leave. It is understood to discuss how the money that will be generated from taxing big business for the scheme could be spent, including on childcare.\n\nThe National Quality Framework is broadly supported by the Productivity Commission, but the report will analyse where it has gone too far.\n\n","byline":"PATRICIA KARVELAS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Budget 2014/Family &amp; Welfare/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Treasury/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Politics News/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T15:37:20.000Z","description":"THE nation’s childcare system faces a significant shake-up, with a draft Productivity Commission report suggesting families be able to access one simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/push-to-allow-subsidies-for-nannies-as-childcare-means-test-in-frame/story-fn59niix-1226974432181?sv=8ad99f2adc82bf58ad7d183d6f8b87f3","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"04242549deefe63f0d0b9936d6b3bfe9","keywords":["income families","childcare payment","childcare rebate","education qualifications","childcare settings","childcare costs","nanny scheme","nanny program","taxpayer money","national quality framework","national trade union","childcare system","means test","marginal tax rates","preschool funding agreement","secondary earners","trade union movement","Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry","Bill Shorten"],"kicker":"EXCLUSIVE","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/push-to-allow-subsidies-for-nannies-as-childcare-means-test-in-frame/story-fn59niix-1226974432181?sv=8ad99f2adc82bf58ad7d183d6f8b87f3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974432181","originalAssetId":"1226974432181","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f4428e246bad09d848112c6d343acbd9","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974432153","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A DRAFT Productivity report suggets families have access to a simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"THE nation’s childcare system faces a significant shake-up, with a draft Productivity Commission report suggesting families be able to access one simplified, means-tested payment that would cover the use of nannies. \n\nTHE nation’s childcare system faces a major shake-up, with the Productivity Commission’s draft report suggesting one simplified payment with a means test that tapers down for high income families, as well as allowing parents to claim the payment for the use of nannies.\n\n","subtitle":"Push to allow subsidies for nannies as childcare means test in frame","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Monkey Business Images Ltd"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Childcare means test in frame","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"e59444ec-0104-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["child","generic","taking care","woman reading","working mother","mother","reading"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226974428463?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974428463","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974432127","subtitle":"e59444ec-0104-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d","title":"Childcare means test in frame","width":100},"title":"Childcare means test in frame"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said the death reported overnight was believed to be the result of a “non-combat related incident’’. However the circumstances were still unclear.\n\nThe fatally wounded soldier was found in a defence administrative building in the capital Kabul at about 2pm Afghanistan time.\n\nHe was evacuated to a medical facility in Kabul where he underwent emergency medical treatment.\n\n“Sadly, the soldier’s injuries were too severe and he later died surrounded by his mates,” said Air Chief Marshal Binskin, who only took over as defence chief on Monday.\n\nThe name of the soldier, from the Sydney-based 2nd Commando Regiment, has not been released.\n\nHe is the 41st Australian to die in Afghanistan, but his is the first death in the Australian Army for almost 13 months.\n\nAlthough Australia quit its Oruzgan base in December, bringing an end to Australia’s longest overseas combat deployment, about 400 Australian troops remain in Afghanistan in training and support roles, mostly in Kabul and Kandahar.\n\nDuring that 12-year combat mission, 40 Australian soldiers were killed and 261 seriously wounded.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin paid his condolences to the soldier’s family and friends, saying he was “highly qualified” and “respected”.\n\nHe declined to reveal any personal details about the man, or say how many tours he had done in Afghanistan.\n\n“He was a highly-qualified, experienced and well respected special forces soldier. His death will impact the nation and we will do all we can to support his family, his friends and his colleagues through the difficult days ahead.\n\n“ADF personnel secured the site overnight to allow coalition Military Police to collect evidence and the Australian Defence Force investigative service has now commenced its investigation.”\n\nThe soldier was serving in the ADF headquarters in Kabul and Air Chief Marshal Binskin said he would not be drawn on speculation about the incident.\n\nThe ADF’s investigative service has begun collecting evidence from the site, he said.\n\n“At this early stage we don’t have all the facts,’’ he said.\n\n“I’m not in a position to speculate about the details or the circumstances surrounding the incident.’’\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Warren Truss offered his sympathies to the soldier’s family, describing the news as tragic considering that Australia’s engagement in Afghanistan has largely ended.\n\n“It is a tragedy that after Australia’s official engagement has largely wound down that we should lose another Australian in Afghanistan,” Mr Truss said.\n\n“I understand there is still 400 Australians in Afghanistan and while the level of danger might not be as great as it was at the height of the war, there’s certainly risks of being in a war zone like Afghanistan.’’\n\nWhen Tony Abbott announced the conclusion of the withdrawal from Oruzgan in December, he said the 12-year war had “been worth it”.\n\n“If you look at the benefits for our country, for Afghanistan, and for the wider world, then my conclusion is yes, it has been worth it,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Abbott said the 400 remaining soldiers would “keep an eye on things” and said there was the possibility they could get “caught up in” combat activity.\n\nAt the time, Mr Abbott rejected concerns Afghan authorities would not be able to maintain stability.\n\nA total of 25,000 Australian troops have served in Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.\n\n* Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78.\n\n","byline":"Rosie Lewis ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Defence/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T01:12:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T01:12:58.000Z","description":"AN Australian special forces soldier has died from a gunshot wound in Afghanistan.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/afghanistan-mission-claims-another-life-with-soldier-found-dead-in-kabul/story-e6frg8yo-1226974752300?sv=625a445cff11d6d738a7846f0025e05d","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"70cb47cdbf83231a30f19a070cda4ad1","keywords":["Australian soldiers","Kabul","Afghanistan","Kandah&#226;r","Defence Force","Marshal Mark Binskin","Australian special","overseas combat deployment","combat mission"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/afghanistan-mission-claims-another-life-with-soldier-found-dead-in-kabul/story-e6frg8yo-1226974752300?sv=625a445cff11d6d738a7846f0025e05d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974752300","originalAssetId":"1226974752300","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Defence/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"cf7ee33dd375db574178b33c7bd39953","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"dlMmVtbjpZLK8GIr0xyMNpO_7wSa506d","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"AN Australian special forces soldier has died from a gunshot wound in Afghanistan.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Afghanistan mission claims another life, with soldier found dead in Kabul","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Gary Ramage"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Afghanistan mission claims another life ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"fe20aac2-017d-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

A loss of 50,000 jobs from the sector would represent a decline of 20 per cent, or 28 per cent should 75,000 jobs fall.\n\nMr Fabo emphasised it was not clear how many of the workers losing their resource-related jobs would end up unemployed. The foreign workers component could return home, and others could be absorbed by other parts of the economy, albeit not on the above-average wages of the resources industry.\n\nThat latter point meant that there could be an out-sized impact on household income and spending. The resources industry is capital rather than job-­intensive. It is not a big employer of workers either way, accounting for only 2 per cent of the total workforce of 11.5 million people. But it does underpin ANZ expectations that Australia’s trade balance will improve from a deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2012 to a surplus of more than 2 per cent over the next three years.\n\nDespite being more bearish than most on iron ore prices, the ANZ expects iron ore exports — Australia’s biggest — to grow from $55bn in 2012 to $75bn by 2020, helped in part by a fall in the dollar to about US84c.\n\nExports of LNG, where $170bn in investment in Queensland and Western ­Australia is fast coming to an end, are forecast to rise in value from $15bn in 2013 to $67bn in 2020.\n\nAnd despite the hit on jobs, Canberra is set to benefit from additional company tax revenue.\n\n“This phase of the mining boom, however, will not be as lucrative as Phase I,” ANZ said.\n\n","byline":"BARRY FITZGERALD

the development of Australia’s far north, has invested in the agribusiness sector, after two decades spent building up her private company, Hancock Prospecting, into a mining behemoth.\n\n“She is really putting her money where her mouth is,” said a person familiar with the deal.\n\nHancock Prospecting said today it had bought a 50 per cent interest in the Liveringa and Nerrima cattle stations, which measure a combined 4700 sq km.\n\nThe Australian understands that Hancock Prospecting had been negotiating the deal for about eight months and is also close to finalising talks to purchase other pastoral assets in the region, as part of a quest by Mrs Hancock to become a key player in the industry.\n\nMrs Rinehart’s mining rival, Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest, is embarking on a similar quest after buying Western Australia’s biggest beef producer, Harvey Beef, for more than $30 million in May.\n\nThe twin deals confirm that Mrs Rinehart and Mr Forrest view the potential growth in demand for Australian beef is in the same way they have grown rich from China’s soaring demand for the Pilbara’s iron ore over the past decade.\n\nThe largely untapped Chinese market is seen as the holy grail for the Australian beef industry, both for processed beef and live cattle exports.\n\nIn another deal last month, WA meat processor V & V Walsh entered a $1 billion joint venture with the Inner Mongolian government and a Chinese farming group that will provide a massive boost to the company’s lamb and cattle exports to China.\n\nHancock said today it had entered a 50:50 joint venture to buy the cattle stations with the Laitt family’s private company Dowford Investments, the parent of Milne Agrigroup, one of WA’s biggest agribusiness groups.\n\nMilne Agrigroup’s businesses include Milne Feeds, Mt Barker Free Range Chicken and Plantagenet Free Range Pork.\n\nThe joint venture has also acquired the mothballed Waroona Abattoirs, which was previously one of WA’s biggest meat processors.\n\nHancock said it had invested in the venture to provide capital and commercial knowledge to support the industry as it targets expansion into global markets.\n\n“Australia’s north has vast potential as a food producer and we are well placed to meet the growing needs of our Asian neighbours,” Mrs Rinehart said.\n\n“We are already exporting some of the finest produce in the world.\n\n“My family has had a long history in the West Australian pastoral industry with our interest continuing over generations in Mulga Downs Station in the Pilbara.\n\n“I spent part of my childhood growing up on Mulga Downs and in the Pilbara, and have had a life-long regard for people in the outback, particularly in Northern Australia,” she said.\n\nMilne Agrigroup managing director Graham Laitt said he was pleased to welcome an investor with Hancock’s capital and knowledge of export markets.\n\n“We are especially pleased that Mrs Rinehart has been attracted to Liveringa and Nerrima,” he said.\n\n“The first step for the industry is for it to increase its scale so that it can be a reliable supplier in the emerging export markets.”\n\n","byline":"Andrew Burrell

Robinson’s brother claimed to have lost his phone at the races before the image found its way on to social media.\n\nApart from his public appearance on Nine, Carney remained holed up in his Cronulla home yesterday where he was visited by several teammates who are unhappy with the club for his sudden sacking.\n\n“I just hope that this isn’t the end of me as a footballer,’’ an emotional Carney said.\n\n“It’s definitely not going to be the end of me as a person. I’m stronger than that.\n\n“I’ve been through this situation before but this is probably the toughest (one). It’s just disappointing. It’s something that I didn’t know was out there and didn’t know it would ever surface like this.\n\n“To receive the message on Saturday night was just gut wrenching. It made me feel sick straight away.\n\n“It was just a prank. The boys have seen me muck around doing it before and I didn’t think there was a photo going to be taken and definitely didn’t think there was going to be a photo in public.\n\n“As much as it’s hurt Cronulla as a club and my career, it’s hurt my pride and my dignity as a person. It’s hurt my mum and sisters.’’\n\nCarney’s heartfelt plea will fall on deaf ears as Doyle’s statement indicates the game has finally lost patience with the former Dally M Medal winner after Cronulla became the third club in six years to show him the door.\n\nThe Raiders were the first to sack him in 2008 after a string of offences, including urinating on the head and neck of a man in the trough of a Canberra nightspot. The NRL backed the club by banning Carney for the 2009 season.\n\nHe was thrown a lifeline by the Sydney Roosters in 2010 and gave up alcohol for the season on his way to being crowned the game’s best player.\n\nHowever he slipped back into his bad old ways and was sacked in 2011 after several alcohol-related incidents.\n\nWith the NRL no longer his safety net, Carney could be forced to look overseas for opportunities but any hopes he has of joining the English Super League look doomed as his criminal record would make it difficult for him to obtain a working visa.\n\nCarney has faced court a number of times during his career, including for a drunken rampage in Goulburn in 2009 (the magistrate banned him from his home town) and for drink-driving in 2011 (he was warned he would go to jail if he faced court again).\n\nThat could leave Carney faced with the prospect of switching codes with French rugby union his most likely option. He could also return to Atherton in north Queensland where he played in 2009 during his exile and worked as a barman.\n\n","byline":"Stuart Honeysett ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/NRL/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-06-30T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-30T11:58:38.000Z","description":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents, the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/its-all-over-nrl-bans-todd-carney-for-life/story-fnca0von-1226972926592?sv=af0a443549dc3e9c7114fbc90988f53c","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"153cfcc05731c3083430263ecf577e28","keywords":["chief operating officer","French rugby union","worded statement","criminal record","sudden sacking","working visa","Sydney Roosters","Luke Lewis","Paul Gallen","Jim Doyle","Todd Carney","Danny Weidler","Steve Noyce","Adam Taylor","Mick Robinson","alcohol-related incidents","Adam taylor","social media","switching codes","heartfelt plea","public appearance","multi-million dollar","Queensland","Australia","Cronulla","New South Wales","Cronulla Sharks"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/its-all-over-nrl-bans-todd-carney-for-life/story-fnca0von-1226972926592?sv=af0a443549dc3e9c7114fbc90988f53c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972926592","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/NRL/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"2578e7cd69eae6b5f214b8e024d53ef3","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"cwZnZpbjpUonYqsf7e4jmPWvePWy-Ljd","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"ffba0e0b3f683bdf55679cecf83eac74","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"pqMW1pbjrxk9rqI5yTE_iBAK_elmzAzz","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"93614f92368a16da292c132bc4863b43","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925366","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"fc58e073de39e74a6abfe8383868d604","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925420","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"0e7660a0b13b544075ab3ad715c66ce7","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925446","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"IT appears after three sackings and countless other alcohol-related incidents, the NRL has effectively banned Todd Carney for life. \n\nHaving already lost his multi-million dollar contract at Cronulla after a photograph was published on social media of him indulging in a lewd act at a pub urinal, the NRL issued a strongly worded statement which suggested he had no future in the competition.\n\n","subtitle":"It’s all over: NRL bans Todd Carney for life","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Adam Taylor"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Todd Carney at Sydney airport after the Sharks returned from Brisbane after their shock win over the Broncos on Friday night Picture: Adam Taylor","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"8ae63d98-0005-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["taylor","kid-free","picture","Cronulla Sharks","Broncos","Todd Carney","Adam Taylor"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/theaustralian/images/1226972925340?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972925340","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226972269280","subtitle":"8ae63d98-0005-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1","title":"Todd Carney at Sydney airport after the Sharks returned from Brisbane after their shock w","width":100},"title":"It’s over: NRL bans Carney for life"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"His message was endearingly humble, reading simply: “Erm, OK then...........” It has earned him 4600 favourites and counting.\n\nHe followed it up by retweeting a fellow Australian hero — Hugh Jackman — who posted: “Aussie Aussie Aussie @NickKyrgios.

Krygios is the youngest player to reach the quarter-finals at a grand slam since his compatriot, who managed the feat aged 18 years 255 days at Wimbledon 2011.\n\nEven his mother didn’t think he’d do it, Krygios revealed after the match with mock-annoyance. He intended to “send her a smiley” in retort.\n\nOne particular between-the-legs shot by the rampaging player during his fourth-round win made waves with his observers. John McEnroe declared the “shot of the year” beyond belief.\n\nThe cheeky teenager even performed what he called a “juicy wiggle” victory dance at the end of the match.\n\nNadal was less than impressed: “I think that I didn’t play really bad.\n\n“I think in the second and the third set I was better than him, but I was not able to convert that opportunities. And for the rest, I think he play better than me.\n\n“So, in general, talking about what you need to win in this surface, he did the things better than me.”\n\nBut can the Australia’s young champion match his stunning 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 scoreline in his quarter-final clash against Canadian Milos Raonic?\n\nIt was left to the teen sensation to have the last word for now, with Kyrgios posting: “Have to do it all again tomorrow and I can’t wait! First @Wimbledon & I’m in the last 8 club! #HaveThat.”\n\n","byline":"Emma Reynolds ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Media/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Media/Digital/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The World/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-02T02:15:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T02:16:21.000Z","description":"NICK Kyrgios celebrated his spectacular win over world number one Rafael Nadal as any self-respecting 19-year-old would: with a tweet.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-kicks-off-twitter-frenzy-over-nadal-defeat-at-wimbledon/story-fnbe6xeb-1226974774338?sv=8489506774592986fa6d32d8d7c45777","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"1c2a48433b731b8b9515778a5bd386bb","keywords":["amazing attitude","Aussie Aussie","four-set win","spectacular win","Aussie Aussie Aussie","fellow Australian hero","Fellow tennis player","Victory extraordinary","permanent wedgie","young wildcard","Malcolm Fraser","Canberra","Australian Capital Territory","Australia","Rafael Nadal","Zed Seselja","Emily Scott","Tony Abbott","Hugh Jackman","Jimmy Connors","Emma Reynolds","Shane Warne","Andrew Leigh","async src","Extraordinary performance","blockquote class"],"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-kicks-off-twitter-frenzy-over-nadal-defeat-at-wimbledon/story-fnbe6xeb-1226974774338?sv=8489506774592986fa6d32d8d7c45777","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974774338","originalAssetId":"1226974774338","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Tennis/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"13cdea9b24d050598812bdb4222d6461","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974773960","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"NICK Kyrgios celebrated his spectacular win over world No 1 Rafael Nadal as any self-respecting 19-year-old would: with a tweet.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Nick Kyrgios kicks off Twitter frenzy over Nadal defeat at Wimbledon","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Kyrgios leads Twitter victory march","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"c149cccc-0174-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

The not-for-profit entity would consult the states about their involvement in the rollout, Mr Pyne’s office said.\n\n“There are no silver bullets for school reform, however international evidence shows there is a single keystone: effective instruction,’’ Mr Pearson said.\n\n“The Australian education system routinely fails children from low socio-economic backgrounds, indigenous children and those in remote communities. As a developed country, we should not willingly accept that a child’s background determines their education success.’’\n\nCheryl Canon, the principal who introduced DI to the primary school in Mr Pearson’s home town of Hope Vale, said the approach had made a big difference. “It gets the kids to take responsibility for learning, to pay attention in class, get the lessons done, do the tests and pass them,’’ Ms Canon said. “They really participate.’’\n\nAustralian Institute for Teaching and School Learning chairman John Hattie said NAPLAN test results showed the 700 students involved in the Cape York trial had made one and a half times the literacy and numeracy gains of those in similar schools.\n\nCritics insist that Direction Instruction and Explicit Instruction, a slightly more interactive form of teaching, straitjacket teachers and stifle innovation in the classroom.\n\nMr Pyne said an important element of DI was that children remained in their “ability level’’ until they mastered the course work, rather than being grouped by age and promoted each year to a higher grade. On Cape York, this meant that 12-year-olds who would normally be in year-7 classes were taught at year-3 level.\n\n“With Direct Instruction, they catch up quickly and they will end up back at the age level appropriate to the year,’’ he said.\n\nAsked whether the program would work in cities, Mr Pyne said: “Where there are areas of disadvantage that can be clearly identified and where Direct Instruction and Explicit Instruction would make the difference between a child succeeding or failing, then I have no qualms about them being introduced beyond remote schools.”\n\nMr Pyne said the government wouldn’t allow young people to leave school without being able to read and write. At present 20 per cent of year 3 students in remote schools failed to meet the national minimum standing in literacy skills, against just 4 per cent in metropolitan areas.\n\nTownsville-based federal Liberal National Party MP Ewen Jones said Direct and Explicit Instruction had the potential to help any child with learning difficulties. “You don’t have to go to ... remote Queensland to find the problem,” Mr Jones said. “It’s happening right here in Townsville.’’\n\n","byline":"JAMIE WALKER ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Indigenous/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/News/The Nation/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/Policy/Education/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T15:36:00.000Z","description":"A CONTROVERSIAL literacy program trialled in Aboriginal communities on Cape York Peninsula is set to be adopted nationally as Christopher Pyne moves to have phonics-based teaching reintroduced to classrooms.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/pyne-eyes-national-direct-instruction-rollout/story-fn59niix-1226974451763?sv=ef9bd0528cc0347fd4ed55cf50c58535","name":"theaustralian.com.au"}],"domains":["theaustralian.com.au"],"id":"a844b6430637baf11da4518a871f9979","keywords":["literacy skills","metropolitan areas","Northern Territory","Australia","Western Australia","Hope Vale","Queensland","literacy program","remote schools","federal government","stifle innovation","state level","teaching approach","straitjacket teachers","struggling child","interactive form","indigenous college","remote-area schools","joint funding","remote communities","education departments","education success","Cairns","Jones","Christopher Pyne","Noel Pearson","John Hattie","international evidence shows","Australian education system","national minimum standing","learning ability","phonics-based teaching","teaching method","indigenous leader","learning difficulties","indigenous children","scripted lesson plan","single keystone","old-school style","being able"],"kicker":"EXCLUSIVE","link":"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/pyne-eyes-national-direct-instruction-rollout/story-fn59niix-1226974451763?sv=ef9bd0528cc0347fd4ed55cf50c58535","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974451763","originalAssetId":"1226974451763","originalSource":"TheAustralian","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/theaustralian.com.au/National Affairs/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"2c1ea88a1e5ca594af4f7c45d4f960f5","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974451737","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A CONTROVERSIAL literacy program trialled in Aboriginal communities on Cape York Peninsula is set to be adopted nationally.","status":"ACTIVE","subscriptionSummary":"A CONTROVERSIAL literacy program trialled in Aboriginal communities on Cape York Peninsula is set to be adopted nationally as Christopher Pyne moves to have phonics-based teaching reintroduced to classrooms. \n\nThe Education Minister predicts parents will start a “revolution’’, demanding that children who are struggling with reading and writing be taught remedially through Direct Instruction or Explicit Instruction.\n\n","subtitle":"Pyne eyes national Direct Instruction rollout","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Lyndon Mechielsen"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Pyne eyes national DI rollout","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"261f6ad8-00fa-11e4-a85d-b094767f573d -

There are still a lot of crocodiles here.”\n\nHe said the catch-22 with the Queensland Government’s approach was that one day numbers would reach critical mass and people would be at risk.\n\n“The thing with crocodiles is that no one wants them to be extinct, but no one wants to be eaten either,” Prof Webb said.\n\n“As their numbers build up, they start eating people.”\n\nProf Webb said the Northern Territory model was working. He said the crocodile population had grown and stabilised and that industries such as tourism and egg harvesting had built up around it.\n\n“ All of the crocodile farms in Queensland buy eggs from the Territory,” he said.\n\nProf Webb said there were “good people” working in Queensland’s Department of Environment but said the wrong decisions were being made.\n\n“Queensland … needs to have a cold, hard look at what it is doing otherwise people will start taking care of them in other ways,” he said.\n\nHe said Queensland and harvesting eggs came up at a recent crocodile management conference in Louisiana.\n\n“People there couldn’t believe Queensland was still making up its mind,” he said.\n\nA spokesman for Queensland Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that under the state’s Crocodile Management Program there were no plans that included the harvesting of eggs in the wild.\n\n","byline":"JOHN ANDERSEN Rural reporter","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Top News/","/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Townsville News and Galleries/","/section/townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"townsvillebulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T21:37:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T21:38:09.000Z","description":"ONE way to stop Queensland’s rising crocodile population from becoming a serious threat to human life is to start management programs such as egg harvesting in the wild.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/croc-population-control-measures-made-snappy/story-fnjfzs4b-1226974591400?sv=e1154c0fcd3fd2b058894878d63c27b0","name":"townsvillebulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["townsvillebulletin.com.au"],"id":"8759bdbf146fab5a5b9dfcbc882eb4c6","keywords":["rising crocodile population","management programs","crocodile management conference","crocodile population","human life","croc population","eating people","crocodile farms","population control","crocodile numbers","Louisiana","United States of America","Adelaide River","Northern Territory","Australia","Andrew Powell","Steve Irwin","commit suicide","realistic management program","healthy croc population","Queensland","Department of Environment","United Nations Organization","Charles Sturt University","John Andersen","Charles Webb"],"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/croc-population-control-measures-made-snappy/story-fnjfzs4b-1226974591400?sv=e1154c0fcd3fd2b058894878d63c27b0","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974591400","originalSource":"TownsvilleBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"0b40d75c673bd4b3e6d2ec6a76a6c586","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974592023","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"ONE way to stop Queensland’s rising crocodile population from becoming a serious threat to human life is to start management programs such as egg harvesting in the wild.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Croc population control measures made snappy ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Croc population control measures made snappy ","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6767c4e6-fdb6-11e3-b7fb-39adc31fbaaa - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["wild crocodile population","viable industries","population","Graham Webb","John Andersen"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/townsvillebulletin/images/1226974591997?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974591997","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974590943","subtitle":"6767c4e6-fdb6-11e3-b7fb-39adc31fbaaa","title":"Croc population control measures made snappy ","width":100},"title":"Croc population control measures made snappy"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"The 6m vessel ran into trouble on Sunday morning, about 40 nautical miles northeast of the city, with water police receiving a distress call about 8.30am.\n\nThe vessel was disabled, adrift and taking on water when the search and rescue effort started.\n\nA QantasLink flight from Moranbah to Townsville was diverted to help with the search and rescue effort.\n\nCaptain Andrew Shearer said he didn’t expect to be called on to help but he was glad to play a part in finding the stricken vessel.\n\n“It was a great feeling knowing we played an important role in the search and rescue mission,” he said.\n\n“When we spotted the small white boat it was in rough waters so if we took our eyes off it, we could have easily lost it.\n\n“We kept orbiting the boat until the coast guard chopper came.

This is upheaval in the sugar industry, the likes of which has never been seen before. Deregulation was a mere hiccup compared to this.\n\nMSF owns 500,000 tonnes of sugar which it is taking out of QSL’s marketing pot of gold. Tully Sugar has another 300,000 tonnes. Singaporean company Wilmar, which runs eight mills between Sarina and Ingham, announced back in April that it would be taking its two million-plus tonnes away from QSL in 2017 and would be marketing it on its own. Effectively QSL has lost more than three million tonnes of sugar to sell on the world market.\n\nYou could fit the sugar it will be left to market post-2017 inside a biscuit tin. Canegrowers Burdekin chairman Phil Marano told Talk of the North yesterday that growers would lose transparency and choice if Wilmar markets all of the Burdekin’s sugar. Marano said growers weren’t saying that it had to be QSL which marketed their sugar, but added that whoever did market it had to provide “choice” in the selling options and “transparency”.\n\nHe conceded Wilmar might “do a good job” but said all transparency would be lost. He said sugarcane growers would become “peasant farmers” and the Government should intervene.\n\nA matter of choice\n\nTULLY Sugar chairman Dick Camilleri is a farmer and, as his title indicates, a miller. Tully Sugar is owned by Asian company Cofco. He said growers have always had a choice of how they wanted to market with QSL and that this would continue with Cofco’s model.\n\nTo market, to market\n\nDICK Camilleri made an interesting point about a lot of the farmer opposition to millers making the call to market the sugar they legally process and own. How it works is that the farmer grows the cane, but once it is harvested and then taken to the train siding to be hauled to the mill it becomes the property of the mill owner.\n\nThe tramlines and locos all belong to the mills. Dick’s theory about a lot of the opposition to what is happening is that it is coming from farmers who have never marketed their own sugar. They might be terrific farmers, but they have never taken any interest in the marketing of their own cane. It has always been handled by QSL. He says they can still do it this way after 2017 if that is what they want, or they can take more control of how their cane is marketed. He says the choice is theirs.\n\nWhere to from here\n\nWHAT remains to be seen after 2017 is whether Wilmar, MSF and Cofco will form their own international sugar trading company. Or will each of them go it alone? There are other smaller independent millers in Queensland. All of them had until yesterday to decide if they would be pulling out of QSL in 2017.\n\nIn the meantime the Canegrowers organisation wants the Government to intervene. This isn’t something the Government is going to be keen to meddle in given that it invites foreign companies to set up business in Australia. Telling them afterwards that they can’t sell the product they make and own in their own factories will not go down well.\n\nYou’d have to think this is a case of stable doors left open and horses already bolted.\n\nWrite on, Megan\n\nRICHMOND woman Megan Stafford, a journalism student at James Cook University has co-won a Journalism Student Walkley Award with Deacon University’s Kirrily Schwarz.\n\nMegan won the award for a column she’s been doing in the North Queensland Register focusing on personalities. Judges said she was someone who had a “hunger” for chasing down stories. As part of her prize, Megan gets to spend eight weeks working with the Nine Network in Sydney and four weeks at the Walkley Foundation for Journalism.\n\nStick a cork in it\n\nYOU can understand sometimes why people in the tourism/customer service industries can become so frustrated with their customers.\n\nI was having dinner in a pub in Winton on Sunday night when a European woman ordered a glass of champagne. A glass of champagne in Winton? “Lady”, I felt like saying, “champagne isn’t exactly a big seller in Winton and no way if they have to open a bottle will you just get one glass. It’s the bottle or nothing”. The barman tried to explain he couldn’t just sell one glass, but she wasn’t having a bar of it. She turned on a scene and then continued to harass wait staff about her meal all during dinner. They were a patient lot. Anywhere else and they would have shown her the door.\n\nRest easy Andy\n\nTHE News of the World phone hacking trail in London is taking its toll even in Townsville. After hearing the outcome on his car radio, a bloke walked into his house after a day’s toil and said “I just heard that Rebekah Brooks got off, but Andy Toulson was found guilty.”\n\n“No dear’, said his wife, “Andy Coulson was found guilty. Andy Toulson works here at the ABC.” “Ugh! Oh yeah, that’s right.” Nice to hear though that our own Andy Toulson is in the clear.\n\nBeaut bloke, though\n\nSO we say goodbye to Ron Boswell from the Senate. He was a good fighter for regional Australia. Bos is built like a brick outhouse and has a head that makes a cement mixer look sexy. Suffice to say, he’s no Brad Pitt.\n\nHe will always be remembered for his campaign slogan “he’s not pretty, but he’s pretty effective”. He also had a certain charm and innocence when it came to same-sex marriage. On the matter of lesbians being joined together in holy matrimony, the thing Bos was most concerned about was that if the lesbians had sons the boys would have no one to take them to the football. You have to like that one.\n\nDoing it tough\n\nTHE Vision Splendid Outback Film Festival is on in Winton.\n\nOut here like much of the inland it’s cold and as dry as the dingo’s proverbial. People like Marty and Sue Mitchell are moving cattle to wherever they can find grass, but the reality is you can drive the 214km from Hughenden to Winton and hardly see a beast. It’s bone dry. It looks like someone has picked the land up, turned it upside down, given it a good shake and emptied everything out.\n\n","byline":"John Anderson

match at Suncorp Stadium, but his selection as Queensland’s 19th man appears to put him in line as a long-serving Maroons’ player.\n\nMorgan got the nod ahead of other fullbacks such as Ben Barba and Anthony Milford, and his utility value — combined with a rugged frame and blistering pace — makes Morgan a prototype Origin player.\n\nThe Cowboys fullback joins other Townsville Brothers juniors Sam Thaiday and Aidan Guerra in Queensland camp on Sunday, but Morgan will still play for the Cowboys against the Dragons this Saturday.\n\n“I wouldn’t have even considered it six months ago,” Morgan said of his Origin call-up.\n\n“Coming back from Christmas I only had a few weeks with the group and I didn’t know if I’d get a trial game in, so I expecting to start the year in the Queensland Cup again.\n\n“It is all a bit out of the blue, so it is hard to believe.”\n\nMorgan has been part of Queensland’s emerging squad and won widespread respect this year following his surprise shift to fullback in place of Lachlan Coote (long-term knee injury), who was expected to fill the boots of former Cowboys’ custodian Matt Bowen.\n\nMorgan has produced several big plays in both attack and defence this year, and his ability to deliver in almost all circumstances makes him arguably North Queensland’s most important attacking asset behind club co-captain Johnathan Thurston.\n\nCooper Cronk’s surprise call-up yesterday put Daly Cherry-Evans on Queensland’s bench, but there could be a possibility that if Cooper were to fail a fitness test Cherry Evans might start at No. 7, and Morgan would gain a promotion to Queensland’s interchange.\n\nBut Morgan firmly dismissed the hypothetical scenario.\n\n“I’m not going to be playing Wednesday night, but being around the group and getting to experience what it’s all about is what I’m looking forward to,” he said.\n\n“I think it will be weird when I actually get there.\n\n“It’s a massive honour and I’m looking forward to next week when I get to be around everyone.”\n\nMorgan got news of his call-up on Sunday night from Cowboys general manager of football Peter Parr, but is yet to speak with Maroons’ coach Mal Meninga.\n\nMorgan is one of four players in Queensland’s Game III squad to have played junior football in Townsville, with former Kirwan State High School student Jacob Lillyman starting at prop.\n\n“I don’t know a lot of the players but I’ve met a couple of them,” Morgan said.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it and it should be a good week or so that I’m in there.”\n\nQueensland: Billy Slater, Darius Boyd, Greg Inglis, Justin Hodges, Will Chambers, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Jacob Lillyman, Cameron Smith (capt), Nate Myles, Aidan Guerra, Sam Thaiday, Corey Parker.\n\nInterchange: Daly Cherry-Evans, Ben Te’o, Matt Gillett, Dave Taylor.\n\nReserves: Josh McGuire, Michael Morgan.\n\n","byline":"MICHAEL THOMPSON Sports

secure, they want their home to be maintained so they can lock up and leave if they go on holidays and they want to walk their dog or let their kids play in their street knowing that they’re safe,’’ Mr Torrisi said.\n\n“Gated communities offer this level of security and maintenance without having to downsize to a unit plus their body corporate fees are often more reasonable and they still offer a great array of fully serviced facilities.’’\n\nMr Torrisi has listed a home at 46 Pebble Lane in the gated community of Royal Palms Estate at Kirwan, which backs on to the Willows Golf Course, and he has noticed an influx of buyers interested in living behind lock and key.\n\n“I have had lots of interest in the location from young families, retirees and single parents seeking this easy way of life,’’ he said.\n\n“There are about 100 properties in the estate so it is a large community but very tight with a real village feel.\n\n“The on-site facilities, which include a Community Hall that features a lap pool, large deck, gym and function room complete with a fully equipped kitchen, are a massive drawcard.\n\n“Plus the entire estate is immaculate with groundsmen maintaining all front yards and streetscapes.’’\n\nAnd the current owners, Melissa and Matthew Burton, agree it’s a dream lifestyle that they’ve enjoyed for three years with 10-month-old daughter Macie in their four-bedroom, two-bathroom home, with double garage, open planned design and garden courtyard.\n\n“My wife and I thought it would be a great place to move into as a young professional couple who don’t want to spend a lot of time doing maintenance work,” said Mr Burton, a sport and recreation co-ordinator for the Townsville City Council.\n\n“I was travelling a fair bit and having a fully-fenced community made us feel safe.’’\n\n“There are also many children who play around the area as Royal Palms Estate is actually very kid-friendly and great for young families because it’s close to schools and shops.”\n\n“And if you love golf it’s a big bonus as you can drive your golf buggy from your house right on to the green.’’\n\nThe Pebble Lane property, listed for $379,000, is open for inspection tomorrow from 11.15-11.45am.

a five-man bench, which will be cut to four later this week.\n\nThe two Intrust Super Cup players are yet to play a National Rugby League game, but at least one is guaranteed to make his first-grade debut on Saturday against St George-Illawarra at Kogarah.\n\nThere is a possibility Spina and Hoare could both play, but Green is likely to keep Ethan Lowe and John Asiata on his bench.\n\nMichael Morgan has moved to halfback in place of co-captain Johnathan Thurston, who has entered Queensland’s State of Origin camp, while Wright fills Morgan’s role at fullback.\n\nThere was hope that Ray Thompson would return from a hamstring injury, which could have kept Morgan at fullback, but Morgan said he was prepared for his return to No. 7.\n\n“I had a little go at it this morning at training … it’s been in the back of my mind that I might have to that, so I’ll just do my best,” he said.\n\n“I just have to get back into kicking and taking more of a role organising with talking without Johnno there, so I’ll see how I go.”\n\nAshton Sims is set to start at prop in place of James Tamou, who is in camp with New South Wales, while Scott Bolton retains his No. 8 spot from last weekend’s 20-18 win over South Sydney.\n\nInjury has brought North Queensland’s playing stocks to breaking point, and Green is hopeful that Saturday’s clash — and next Wednesday’s Origin finale — does not bring any more injury woes.\n\n“Hopefully the footy gods can be a little bit kinder to us,” he said.\n\n“We get a bye in there (after Origin) which will be good, and we can freshen up and then finish with a run.”\n\nBoth Hoare and Spina will be desperate to make Green’s cut after spending the past few seasons playing for the Mackay Cutters and Northern Pride respectively.\n\nHoare is one of the biggest forwards in North Queensland’s first grade squad, and Spina is the son of inaugural Cowboys captain Laurie Spina.\n\nThe Spinas will become the first father-son combination to play first grade for the Cowboys if Ben suits up on Saturday.\n\n“The challenge for us now is to put in another good performance,” Green said.\n\n","byline":"MICHAEL THOMPSON Sports

And then there’s the guest room – stunning work.\n\n“What a massive turnaround last week.”\n\nLisa was shocked by the ­result. “Adam and I have been waiting for this feeling for a very long time in this com-­petition, and by gosh, it feels amazing,” she said.\n\nAdam and Lisa had even more reason to smile when Tasmanian rivals Brooke and Grant copped a caning from the judges.\n\nTheir hessian ceiling in the master bedroom was said to look like a ‘camp site’.\n\nSouth Australia’s Bomber and Mel also got hit hard for not sticking to the ‘laid back coastal’ rule for their entry, dining room, laundry and front deck.\n\nAdam and Lisa finished with 30, Candy and Ryan 25, Carole and Russell 23, Brooke and Grant 19 and Bomber and Mel 18.\n\nBrooke and Grant got a dose of karma when Adam and Lisa had to choose which team would be stuck in the tent this week.\n\nThe Victorians decided their Tassie rivals could camp out this week as teams renovate Bomber and Mel’s home. That was a decision that clearly pleased some of the other teams as well. “The karma bus has just come and it has parked in Tassie’s front lawn,” Ryan laughed. “All aboard”.\n\n","byline":"COLIN VICKERY ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Top News/","/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Townsville News and Galleries/","/section/townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"townsvillebulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-06-02T21:34:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-06-02T21:40:06.000Z","description":"THE tears flowed on Channel 7 reality show House Rules last night as Townsville couple Maddison Carter and Lloyd Wright were left “blown away” by the show’s first three perfect 10s delivered in the reveal of the renovation of their Pallarenda home.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/tears-flow-on-house-rules-as-townsville-couple-blown-away-by-shows-first-three-perfect-10s-delivered-in-reveal/story-fnjfzs4b-1226940971191?sv=423247add4595938be863ee84ea41757","name":"townsvillebulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["townsvillebulletin.com.au"],"id":"37d0d2fe17f739d09d6b53266cf64192","keywords":["stunning result","massive turnaround","master bedroom","dining room","hessian ceiling","Victorian couple","guest room","House rules","reality show","style home","easiest run","guest bedroom","camp site","karma bus","South Australia","Australia","Our House","Adam","Ryan"],"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/tears-flow-on-house-rules-as-townsville-couple-blown-away-by-shows-first-three-perfect-10s-delivered-in-reveal/story-fnjfzs4b-1226940971191?sv=423247add4595938be863ee84ea41757","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940971191","originalSource":"TownsvilleBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"5d588e0442c0b09216d4d1a13bc9f3ec","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940970866","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"486580747979b67c359c6e1ea99a453e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940970894","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ea7659f65631e27bfc614126c1aab7a3","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940970946","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ef67793d8f42e89b894eee6584181a49","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940971137","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"9a3adcb646492fa2396e18d44f10bbc4","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940972000","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE tears flowed on Channel 7 reality show House Rules last night as Townsville couple Maddison Carter and Lloyd Wright were left “blown away” by the show’s first three perfect 10s delivered","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Tears flow on House Rules as Townsville couple “blown away” by show’s first three perfect 10s delivered in reveal ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Tara Croser"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"House rules couple “blown away”","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"48a5ab30-ea9d-11e3-82c4-4cab92387936 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["House Rules stars","Farm Racecourse","Lloyd Wright"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/townsvillebulletin/images/1226940970823?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226940970823","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226940970797","subtitle":"48a5ab30-ea9d-11e3-82c4-4cab92387936","title":"House rules couple “blown away”","width":100},"title":"House rules couple “blown away”"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"Infrastructure Australia predicts northern Australia’s population to jump to 1.77 million people in 2031, up from 1.2 million in 2011, with most of the growth occurring in North Queensland.

an intense reassessment by the architect and the University as to how contemporary students can learn,” the panel said in their decision.\n\n“The resulting building and spaces are extraordinarily diverse and effective providing an enormously successful learning environment and a major contribution to the University’s urban landscape.”\n\nIt comes after the same building last month took out the Australian New Construction Major Facility category of the Council of Educational Facility Planners International in Adelaide after a unanimous decision from judges.\n\nThe design was previously named “Building of the Year” at the North Queensland Architectural Awards in March.\n\nIt will now compete in the national AIA awards, which will be held in November.\n\nJCU’s College of Arts, Society and Education dean Professor Nola Alloway, said the award was a further reflection of extensive consultation and collaboration to determine how an upgrade could best improve student services and support contemporary methods of teaching and learning.\n\n“The School staff worked with the architect to create innovative spaces with a view to optimising student engagement, motivation and learning outcomes,” he said.\n\nThe facility includes large-scale active learning spaces that support technology-enabled active learning (TEAL) areas.\n\n","byline":"HARRY BRUMPTON

Wright’s renovated Pallarenda home on House Rules, the 27-year-olds have revealed they initially thought they would be passed over for a metropolitan pair because of their regional roots.\n\n‘‘  We were competing against all these Brisbane couples, so we’re stoked they came to Townsville, because it was a big ask as the logistics would have been so difficult with transporting equipment, flying up crew and sourcing supplies,’’ Maddi said.\n\nHowever Channel 7 decided it was well worth the trouble of going outside the big smoke for these genetically blessed contestants, with the former swimsuit model and her well-built fiance securing Queensland’s only spot on the second season as the first regional, non-capital city couple to appear on the show and they have proven to be a popular choice.\n\n‘‘ Everyone seems to like Maddi because she’s sweet and gets what she wants without being mean, and Lloyd because he’s got great muscles,’’ executive producer Maxine Gray said.\n\nMaddi, the Cowboys community relations executive from Brisbane, and Lloyd, a Townsville Airport aviation firefighter from Cairns, are not actually born-and-bred locals after relocating here two years ago however their relaxed, laid-back attitudes on our screens have ensured they have been embraced as our own.\n\n‘‘ With our home transformation finally airing we’ve really noticed what a great local following we have – everywhere we go we are holding babies and getting photos,’’ Maddi said.\n\n‘‘ I think we’ve showcased Townsville really well and put it on the map as a beautiful little gem where you can have a tropical lifestyle on a budget and it will be our forever home.’’\n\nThis week the other contestants were salivating over Maddi and Lloyd’s four-bedroom, one-bathroom 701sq m 1950s reno just a stone’s throw from the beach, a property they bought in April 2013 for $372,000.\n\n‘‘ Some of them were so in love with the prime location and good house prices in Townsville that they actually looked at property to buy when they were up here,’’ Lloyd said.\n\nHowever the pair’s bargain buy has not been without its share of problems on the show – with rot and mould, leaky taps, uneven floors, an almost unusable kitchen and outdated bathroom providing challenges for their competition.\n\nBut viewers have to wait until 7.30pm on Monday to find out whether or not the Pallarenda pair got the ‘‘ beachy entertainer’’ of their dreams, though they did reveal that it is a ‘‘ massive transformation that will blow everyone away’’.\n\nMaddi and Lloyd are currently in third place on

The Rudd Government inherited a $20 billion surplus, but left office with a $30 billion deficit (albeit while dealing with the GFC).\n\nLargely because of this perceived profligacy, Labor was booted out of power after just two terms.\n\nThe Abbott Government was then elected, in large part, to bring the budget back to surplus.\n\nBut the government is caught up in a number social issues no one seems to care about. The Racial Discrimination Act, Knights and Dames and school chaplains are the furthest things from the mind of the average Australian, yet they seem to be front and centre in Tony Abbott’s.\n\nMeanwhile in Queensland, the Newman Government’s controversial crackdown on bikies and its ongoing war with the judiciary detracts from its good budget stories.\n\nThe two governments’ focus on non-economic issues has coincided with a fall in the polls.\n\nThe Abbott Government’s current slide in the polls began in April this year – immediately after the restoration of the Knights and Dames royal titles and its attempt to weaken the Racial Discrimination Act.\n\nSo what would happen if a Labor government didn’t spend money like it was going out of style?\n\nAnd how would the Coalition fare if it didn’t act like that annoying, offensive, out-of-touch relative at a family get-to-together? Well, we only need to look at recent history.\n\nThe Hawke and Keating Labor governments enacted some of the most important economic reforms this country has seen – such as floating the dollar and lowering tariffs – and returned the budget to surplus after the recession of the early 1980s.\n\nIt was this economic success that enabled the government to continue supporting the most vulnerable in society without people thinking it was spending like, well, a Labor government.\n\nAlternatively, if a Coalition government could effectively manage the economy without getting sidetracked on conservative social issues – like the Howard Government did for most of the time – then they would no doubt be duly rewarded at the ballot box.\n\nAbbott and Newman need to quickly realise they weren’t elected to foist their worldview on the public.\n\nUnless they do, people won’t be able to stand them any longer ... and they will elect a government they probably can’t afford.\n\n","byline":"Anthony Galloway ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Opinion/","/section/townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/","/section/townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"townsvillebulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:07:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T22:08:05.000Z","description":"I ONCE heard a saying about Australian politics: We keep Labor until we can’t afford them anymore, and we keep the Coalition until we can’t stand them anymore.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/opinion/coalition-social-policy-surplus-to-need/story-fnjfzqwh-1226974617281?sv=9a65e7f97975dd83a5e687269cc3eb37","name":"townsvillebulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["townsvillebulletin.com.au"],"id":"f5e81dab4327696463b7fae20c2e3a60","keywords":["conservative social issues","Australian politics","number social issues","controversial crackdown","royal titles","average Australian","Queensland","Australia","Tony Abbott","social issues","ongoing war","non-economic issues","economic success","economic reforms","lowering tariffs","school chaplains"],"link":"http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/opinion/coalition-social-policy-surplus-to-need/story-fnjfzqwh-1226974617281?sv=9a65e7f97975dd83a5e687269cc3eb37","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974617281","originalSource":"TownsvilleBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/townsvillebulletin.com.au/Townsville Bulletin/Opinion/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","related":[],"standFirst":"I ONCE heard a saying about Australian politics: We keep Labor until we can’t afford them anymore, and we keep the Coalition until we can’t stand them anymore.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Coalition social policy surplus to need","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Coalition social policy surplus to need","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"da2aef72-016b-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Bulletin journalist","Galloway","Anthony","Townsville","bulletin","journalist","Anthony Galloway"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/townsvillebulletin/images/1226974619997?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974619997","originalSource":"News Limited","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974617253","subtitle":"da2aef72-016b-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1","title":"Coalition social policy surplus to need","width":100},"title":"Coalition social policy surplus to need"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"Bree Elizabeth Benyon, a former V8 Grid Girl and Bikini Babe finalist, supplied four ecstasy pills to Ashley Craperi and tried to source another five tablets for him.\n\nBenyon’s barrister, Greg Lynham, told Townsville District Court yesterday that his client had already been punished after local media reports about her charges.\n\n“The courts long recognise that public humiliation and shame is always a factor that’s relative to the sentencing process,” he said.\n\n“As a consequence of the behaviour that brings her to court today, already she’s suffered embarrassment and humiliation due to her conduct being exposed as broadly as it has been as a consequence of the article in the .”\n\nBenyon, 24, gained further notoriety in the past month after an image of her bound and gagged appeared on a relative’s ute tray.\n\nShe pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying dangerous drugs.

I’m just so glad that it’s brought about more awareness of Crohn’s disease, and it’s made me feel so much more confident.”\n\nBethany was fitted with her colostomy bags after battling with Crohn’s disease since the age of three. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, affecting the sufferer’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste.\n\nIn extreme situations like Bethany’s, it becomes necessary to remove the damaged section of the intestine and bring the healthy part out as a stoma — known as a colostomy.\n\nAfter almost dying when her bowel ruptured in 2010, Bethany woke from a life-saving operation to find she had been fitted with two colostomy bags.\n\n“Growing up I’d had various surgeries to try and combat the Crohn’s,” said Townsend. “I’d go in and have sections of my intestine cut out, but I’d only be in remission for a couple of weeks before it came back again.\n\n“Then, four years ago I woke up in the morning and couldn’t move because I was in so much agony. I had to break a glass on the floor to alert my mum who called on ambulance. When the paramedics came they lifted up my top to see that my surgery scar had split open. I was rushed to intensive care where they doctors told me family I would need more surgery as my intestines had become infected and inflamed again. I had no idea when I woke up that I would have the bags.\n\n“When I first woke up and my mum told me about them I was just relieved as I’d thought I was going to die. When I came out of hospital and everything finally sunk in, I remember going upstairs into my bedroom and just bursting into tears.\n\n“I’d known a colostomy bag might have been an option but it was always something that I had wanted to avoid. I had a really good cry that day, and since then I haven’t shed another tear — I’ve just got on with it I suppose.”\n\nIt was only after Townsend met and married her husband, Ian, 33, and jetted off to Mexico last Christmas that she finally felt ready to embrace the colostomy bags.\n\n“When I met Ian I showed him my bags straight away, but he didn’t bat an eye lid — I actually felt like I was overreacting,” she said.\n\n“He taught me that there was more to me than the bags and would always encourage me to show off my figure. I wasn’t sure but in Mexico I finally realised he was right, and decided to wear my bikini.\n\n“At first I was nervous and worried that people would stare but it was fine. The staff at the hotel asked me about the bags on the last day of the holiday, but rather than being offended I was glad because it meant I could talk to them about Crohn’s and tell them what it is.\n\n“I decided to get in touch with Crohn’s and Colitis UK Facebook group to see if they would let me post something on their page. I sent them the picture and my information, and it all blew up from there.”\n\nTownsend still suffers from Crohn’s disease and hopes ones day for a cure, but for now she is considering getting back into modelling — a career she gave up on after she was fitted with the bags.\n\n“I feel confident enough now to put myself out there and pursue modelling again,” she said.\n\n“I did a little bit of work here and there before I had the colostomy bags, but once I had them fitted I thought that was the end of the dream. I’m looking forward to chasing my goals, and I know now that nothing can hold me back.\n\n“I won’t let the Crohn’s control me anymore.”\n\n","byline":"Caters News ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle -

The tape is applied to an injured muscle or tendon and as the muscle or joint lengthens, the tape is stretched to absorb load and reduce the work on the muscles. This results in decreased workload, demand on the muscle and improved tolerance to fatigue.\n\nManaging Director of Dynamic Tape, Ryan Kendrick, told news.com.au he had no idea Kyrgios was using his Tribal Tape, but wasn’t surprised that people mistook the product for a real tattoo.\n\n“When I have worn it myself people often ask to see my tattoo and I have had many of my patients recount funny stories like an 85-year-old great grandmother whose son was disgusted with her as he thought she had gone out and got some ink!” he said.\n\nHe said Ana Ivanovic and Sania Mirzer used the tan tattoo version of the product at the Australian Open earlier this year while Tommy Haas wore the black tattoo design. Serena Williams, Laura Robson and Kim Clijsters have also used the product.\n\nKendrick said the tattoo design came about because he was living on Norfolk Island when the tape was developed and wanted to reflect the heritage of the island and the South Pacific.\n\n“The design was given to us by a very well known Polynesian artist and tattooist named Tihoti. Tihoti is Tahitian but his wife is a Norfolk Islander. Norfolk relies heavily on tourism and with the global financial crisis and high Australian Dollar, they were suffering so it was our way of spreading the word about Norfolk Island a little.”\n\nKinesio Australia Education Director, Clint Bridges, says while the tribal tape is not an official Kinesio product, the Kinesio taping method is regularly used on the tennis circuit.\n\n“Novak Djokovic, Li Na and Serena Williams all use a beige form of the tape on court. At a base level, it’s used to try and change the way the muscle is firing. There are specific tensions for different tasks which changes the way the brain thinks that muscle is working.\n\n“Certain tensions provide stimulus on the skin, which sends a message to the brain. The brain then reinterprets that message and sends instructions back to the muscle so it learns how to behave. There would be one tension for relaxation of the muscle if it’s tight and one for activation.”\n\nKendrick said the tape was released commercially in Australia in late 2010, followed by the UK and then North America in 2012. The tape was used by a number of athletes at the London 2012 games and is now available in 25 countries.\n\nSo there you have it, for all those out there wanting the Kyrgios tattoo, you’re in luck.\n\nFor just $15.10, you can buy five metres of the stuff.\n\nWere you fooled by Kyrgios’ tattoo?

HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME\n\nThe “G” is silent. So “Kirr-ee-oss”. Not “Kurr-gee-oss”, like the spelling would suggest.\n\n2. HIS BACKGROUND\n\nKyrgios is Aussie born. A Canberra boy. His father, George, was born in Greece and moved to Australia as a child. His mother, Norlaila, is Malaysian.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest of three kids. His brother is a lawyer and his sister an actor.\n\n3. HE WAS A CHUBBY KID\n\nKyrgios’ mother, Norlaila, admits her boy ate too much as a child. He loved his food.\n\nBut he eventually stretched out into a lean 1.93m (6ft 4in), 77kg frame and lost the puppy fat.\n\nMORE: The shot that stunned the world \n\nMORE: Legends, celebs in shock over Aussie Nick \n\nMORE: Why you don’t need to cheer for Tomic anymore \n\n4. THE HISTORY HE’S CREATED\n\nWith his 7-6 (7-5), 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory over Nadal — one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon history — Kyrgios became the first teenager to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Nadal did it himself against Roger Federer in the 2005 French Open. An ominous sign.\n\nThe youngest man in the men’s draw, the 144th-ranked Kyrgios also became the first player ranked outside the top 100 to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Andrei Olhovsky defeated Jim Courier at Wimbledon in 1992.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon since compatriot Bernard Tomic in 2011 and the first to reach the quarter-finals on debut since German Florian Mayer 10 years ago.\n\n5. BASKETBALL BECKONED\nCanberra is boasting right now about being the home of Australia’s hottest sporting stars. NBA star Patty Mills, the “next big thing” in basketball Dante Exum and Kyrgios are all products of the nation’s capital. Kyrgios was a hoops-mad kid as well, representing Australia in basketball as a young teen before making tennis his sole focus as a 14-year-old. He still loves the Boston Celtics.\n\n6. THE MONEY GAME\n\nSince turning pro in 2013, Kyrgios has played only 10 matches on ATP Tour. Of those, he has only won three and lost seven (going into Wimbledon).\n\nThis year, he’d won just one match on the pro tour — the Australian Open first round against Benjamin Becker, the namesake of the man Kyrgios has been compared to quite a bit today, Boris Becker.\n\nWhat it all means is he’d won $A248,000 in his career up until Wimbledon. He will walk away from the All England Club with a minimum $A409,806 for reaching the quarter-finals. The Wimbledon champion takes home $A3.19 million.\n\n7. HIS IDOLS\n\nIf Kyrgios can shock the world once more and defeat Raonic tonight, he is on track to meet the man he looked up to most as a child, Roger Federer, in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Another guy he really idolised as a youngster was Nadal.\n\nKyrgios first started playing tennis at six years old, in 2001. By that stage, Federer had already been a pro for three years.\n\n8.

the crème de la crème of boganism for 7mate’s reality show, Bogan Hunters, and the Apple Isle is certainly punching well above its weight.\n\nAfter an exhaustive process of elimination, celebrity judges Angry Anderson, Jonesy, Miss Nude Australia, Tahir Bilgic, Jacko, Chris Franklin, Derek Boyer and Rob Shehadie have selected seven finalists to go through to next Tuesday’s Bogan Hunters Grand Final.\n\nMore: Do bogans know they’re bogans and other important questions\n\nFenech told news.com.au that only the purest of bogans made it through.\n\n“When we started the series I thought it was a bit of a joke. But boganism is a culture. These guys are unashamedly bogans. They love it, they live it, they have a complete lack of any pretence. I reckon the bogan is the true Aussie battler of the new millennium.”\n\nAnd while they are all unique in their embracement of the “culture”, they all have one thing in common. \n\n“It’s a mystery, the teeth of the bogan,” added Fenech, “a bit like the Bermuda Triangle. Could be too many Beam and Cokes, I don’t know. But I would say more than 50 per cent of bogans do have some pretty interesting teeth, that’s for sure. It could be a money thing. It costs a lot to get your teeth fixed.”\n\nHe says the finalists are defined by: “Mullets, thongs, ugg boots, flannelettes, tight jeans, a love of Oz rock, home done tattoos are important, a lack of pretence is very important, as is a willingness to be incredibly honest at all time.”\n\nAustralia, meet your finalists:\n\nMEL: the kinky chick from Munno Para, South Australia \n\nSaid to perfectly represent the “female of the bogan species”. She once stabbed her partner in the neck with a pair of scissors because he poked her too much in the arm.\n\nANDREW: the dad to eight kids to three different mothers from Bridgewater, Tasmania \n\nHas the name of his eight kids tattooed on his arms, all the girls on one arm and the boys on the other. “I can’t remember their dates of birth cos I’m always too smashed. That way if I go to Centrelink and they ask me, well I can say ‘here we go, here’s the date of birth” he said as he showed off the ink.\n\nDARREN: the second worst driver in Tasmania, also from Bridgewater \n\nHas 52 charges of driving with no licence against his name and is proud of it.

My dad owns half of f***ing Manhattan.”\n\nHe also claims he also has both the police and Mayor Bill DeBlasio on his side. Oh and he’s apparently a lawyer too.\n\n“You think a guy who does real estate doesn’t own the cops?”.\n\nBut if that isn’t bad enough; surprise, surprise it turns out Gerry Adjmi isn’t who he says he is at all.\n\nDespite deleting all his social media accounts, US website The Smoking Gun  discovered he isn’t actually who he says he is.\n\nAs it turns out the drunken student is actually Gerry Shalam, a New Jersey man whose father Lou is a garment industry executive, and his mother Frieda an event co-ordinator and member of the Allenhurst Borough zoning and planning board.\n\nThe video, and his apparent claim to fame has attracted a raft of attention on social media with some people calling him a “terrible man child” while others called his behaviour disgusting.\n\n#GerryShalam -BWAAAAAAA!\n\n— Randall Ellis (@rketexas) July 1, 2014 \n\nGerry Shalam is actually a student of #NYU. No surprise that a self-indulgent capitalist is already attending there http://t.co/f7hV8U0Zse\n\n— Donithan (@trollshevikism) July 1, 2014 \n\nSo looks like the drunken NYU students dad who owns half of Manhattan, doesn't actually own half of Manhattan. #gerryshalam\n\n— Tom Strong-Grinsell (@TomSG_) July 1, 2014 \n\nThat terrible manchild who drunkenly proclaimed his father owns half of manhattan is from, of course, New Jersey: http://t.co/2KGm1Yk0QJ\n\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) July 1, 2014 \n\nThis whole Gerry Shalam thing is disgusting. I hope he gets expelled from NYU\n\n— Storey (@storey_ofmylife) July 1, 2014 \n\nAnd while Mr Shalam may be regretting his behaviour, at least he’s not quite as bad as the YouTube clip makes him out to be.\n\nThe 20-year-old co-founded a charitable organisation called Brothers Helping Others that helps low-income immigrant families in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n\nHe is also not totally incorrect regarding the status of the Adjmi family who are indeed wealthy and also in real estate.\n\n","byline":"STAFF WRITERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Technology -

but that means little to the thousands of people living in temporary displacement camps across the country because they were born into a different religion or ethnic group.\n\nAP reported that the militant group’s surge of power and control across Iraq “has thrown the country into its deepest crisis since US troops withdrew in December 2011, and threatens to carve the nation in three along sectarian and ethnic lines.”\n\nMORE: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and ISIS explained\n\nIt is all too easy, from our safe houses here in Australia, to disassociate ourselves from a war happening halfway across the globe. We can get lost in the extremist claims populating mainstream and social media, and put the conflict down to something between men with covered faces, sporting guns.\n\nBut the reality of the situation is that terrified men, women and children have fled their homes across Iraq and Syria, streaming into temporary displacement camps rather than staying to submit to militant control.\n\nThe UN Refugee agency estimates that there are 1 million internally displaced people and 110,000 stateless people in Iraq alone, and the Red Crescent Society pegs over 80 per cent of them as women and young children.\n\nThe amazing pictures you will see below, captured by news photographers in the region, tell a story we will never be able to. Children in temporary displacement camps, children caught by roadside bombs, children scrambling to get food as they enter into the Ramadan period.\n\nThese are the faces of war.\n\n","byline":"Kate Midena ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/news.com.au/Lifestyle/Real Life/","/display/news.com.au/Lifestyle/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/news.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/","/section/perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T23:22:26.000Z","description":"THE current situation in Iraq and Syria is undeniably volatile, complicated and dangerous.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28e-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28g-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixwvgh-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28f-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28h-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28d-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"8ad3bf463e1309262855d7949c404f0f","keywords":["displaced Iraqi","temporary displacement","Syrian refugee","Syrian boy","temporary displacement camps","displaced Iraqi girl","autonomous region","sunset communal meal","makeshift hospital","eastern town","car outside","popular market","rebels fighting","Australia","Najaf","Iraq","Syria","United States of America","Baghdadi","Ammar","Bilal Hussein","Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi","Displaced Iraqi boys","Iraqi federal police","temporary camp","temporary shelter","disassembled tent","family rest","Syrian boy looks","society truck","Iraqi children","AFP PHOTO","ruling authority","news photographers","Al Taji","Mosul","Lebanon","Red Crescent Society","Human Rights Watch","UN Refugee agency"],"kicker":"Pictures","link":"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/faces-of-war-the-reality-facing-children-in-iraq-and-syria/story-fnixw28d-1226974107403?sv=79f2a79a96022b5c6270a82d6c984083","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974107403","originalAssetId":"1226974107403","originalSource":"NewsComAu","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Real Life/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"83d318174984cf5df24c91f6cb40ceb8","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974102805","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"b52c8b513ae3f402d8399636724af3e2","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"c4M25pbjpEZa3nCkN-r-R5Y_IC_ZEwYg","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE terror group proudly publicises its brutal executions and atrocities.

He never regained consciousness.\n\nUS agencies are reporting that Bassel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, of Dearborn, Mich, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm.\n\nScott Herkes, a 39-year-old player in the match, said he was about 25 metres away from the action when he saw Bieniewicz punched by a player on the opposing team. He said the referee was looking down at the time and didn’t see the punch coming.\n\n“It was terrifying,” Mr Herkes told US media. “I have never in my life seen something like this”.\n\nMr Herkes went on to say that Saad had been complaining about a call made by the referee prior to his alleged assault. There were reportedly around 30 players at the game and a handful of spectators, many of whom also witnessed the event.\n\nMr Bieniewicz worked as a medical assistant at a children’s hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a small city near Detroit.\n\n“I speak for all his friends when I say we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go out,” James Acho, Bieniewicz’s friend of 30 years, told the Detroit Free Press . “He deserved better.”\n\n“He just absolutely lived it and loved [soccer],” Mr Acho added.\n\nMr Acho said Bieniewicz is being kept on a ventilator until his organs can be harvested and donated through an organisation called Gift of Life. He will leave behind a wife and two young sons.\n\nMr Saad is alleged to have fled the field after the incident and driven away. His attorney, Brian Berry, said his client cooperated with the police investigation and voluntarily turned himself in.\n\n“Mr. Saad is presumed innocent unless and until a fact finder determines differently,” his legal team said in an email to the Detroit Free Press. “As tragic as this event is, we must keep open minds and listen and wait for all the facts of this case to unfold.”\n\n","byline":"STAFF WRITERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network

JERMAINE JONES’ EPIC FALCON\n\nWe can hardly complain about a lack of goals at this World Cup ... but there has been an outrageous shortage of quality falcons.\n\nJermaine Jones took a step towards changing that this morning, when he copped a ball to the face against Belgium.\n\n9:30am - AMERICANS RESPOND TO THEIR WORLD CUP DEFEAT\n\nYeah but at least we have nukes\n\n— David Pierce (@piercedavid) July 1, 2014 \n\n9:15am — BELGIAN PLAYER VOMITS ON THE FIELD\n\nJan Vertonghen was clearly exhausted after 90 minutes of end-to-end action against the USA.

BELGIUM 2 USA 1\n\nIn my somewhat humble opinion, that was the most exciting game of the World Cup so far, even though it was scoreless after 90 minutes.\n\nBelgium scored twice in the first half of extra time, with goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. The American dream was fading. Then the USA pulled one back at the start of the second half.\n\nThere were several excellent chances to equalise, but the USA couldn’t break through again, so Belgium will go through to play Argentina in the quarterfinals.\n\nUltimately, the Americans will look back on a golden opportunity to win the game in the 92nd minute, just before the end of regular time. The ball fell to Chris Wondolowski seven yards out from goal, but he sliced it wide.\n\nIn all fairness, Belgium was the better side for the vast majority of this match, and would have won easily if not for the heroics of American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who racked up the highest tally of saves by any goalkeeper at a World Cup since 1966.\n\nMATCH REPORT: Belgium v USA \n\n8:20am — THE USA GETS ONE BACK!\n\nOh hang on. Maybe this isn’t over! The USA’s teenage substitute, Green, has volleyed the ball past Courtois to make the score 2-1. Now his team has just over 10 minutes to score another and force the game into a penalty shootout.\n\n8:10am — LUKAKU KILLS THE AMERICAN DREAM\n\nThat must be it. Romelu Lukaku, having played a key role in Belgium’s first goal, has latched onto a through ball and fired it into the net.\n\nTim Howard has tallied 15 saves so far — that’s the most by any goalkeeper at a World Cup since 1966 — but there was nothing he could have done about that.\n\n8:00am — BELGIUM SCORES!\n\nWell, that didn’t take long. Just like Germany did yesterday, Belgium has scored almost immediately in extra time, despite failing to find the net during 90 minutes of regular time.\n\nRomelu Lukaku surged down the right touchline, then sent the ball infield. The American defenders got there first, but couldn’t clear it, and Kevin de Bruyne pounced. That makes it 1-0.\n\n7:55am — FULL TIME ... BELGIUM 0 USA 0\n\nChris Wondolowski missed a golden chance to win the game for the USA deep in stoppage time. The ball looped to his feet seven yards out from goal. He was unmarked. Wondolowski just had to slot it into the net to earn his team a place in the quarterfinals ... but he sliced it horribly.\n\nSo, the game has (somehow) finished scoreless, and we’re going to extra time.\n\nBelgium has had 30 shots on goal, compared to the USA’s five. No prizes for guessing who’s the favourite.\n\n7:40am — HOW GOOD IS TIM HOWARD?\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the USA is clinging to this 0-0 scoreline ... just. There have been several brilliant, desperate blocks from the American defenders, but the man of the match so far is undoubtedly goalkeeper Tim Howard.\n\nThe man is a beast between the posts. That is all.\n\n7:30am — LIVERPOOL PLAYERS EXPECT SUAREZ TO LEAVE\n\nLuis Suarez’s teammates at Liverpool believe the Uruguayan striker has played his last game for the club.\n\nSuarez was sent home from the World Cup in disgrace and banned from football for months after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Reds officials are reportedly nervous about the reception he would get in the Premier League once that ban expires.\n\nSo, they are poised to sell Suarez to Barcelona, in a move that would echo his sale from Ajax to Liveprool in 2011 — he was in the middle of a seven game ban for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal at the time.\n\n7:05am — XHERDAN SHAQIRI IS THE SADDEST MAN ALIVE\n\nSwitzerland’s best player, Xherdan Shaqiri, really lost his composure after that heartbreaking extra time loss to Argentina. You have to feel for the guy.\n\n6:50am — USA AND BELGIUM SCORELESS AT HALF TIME\n\nWe needed this game. Particularly after the borefest between Argentina and Switzerland earlier today.\n\nBelgium and the USA don’t seem to have much interest in defence. I mean, the last ditch stuff has been fantastic, and the American goalkeeper, Tim Howard, has pulled off some great saves, but the ball is flowing from end to end with ridiculous ease.\n\nI’m not complaining, mind you. The match is scoreless at half time, but I can’t imagine it will stay that way for long.\n\n6:40am — NEYMAR TO PLAY AGAINST COLOMBIA\n\nBrazil’s star forward Neymar will be fit to play in his nation’s World Cup quarterfinal against Colombia, despite picking up thigh and knee injuries against Chile, AP reports.\n\nThe Brazilian football confederation says team doctor Jose Luiz Runco checked Neymar when the squad returned to its training camp, and the superstar is not in doubt for Saturday morning’s match.\n\nMORE: The full report on Neymar’s fitness \n\n6:25am — A BAD OMEN FOR THE USA\n\nThis game between Belgium and the USA is the last round of 16 tie. So far, every match in the round has been won by the team that topped its pool.\n\nBrazil, the Netherlands, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Argentina and Germany have all advanced to the quarterfinals. All of them beat sides that came second in the group stage.\n\nBelgium finished on top of Group H, and the USA was the runner-up to Germany in Group G, so if the pattern continues, Belgium will go through here.\n\n6:05am — ARGENTINA 1 SWITZERLAND 0\n\nAngel Di Maria’s winner in the dying minutes of extra time saved Argentina from the prospect of a penalty shootout against the stubborn Swiss.\n\nAfter 118 minutes of frustration reminiscent of Argentina’s pool match against Iran, Lionel Messi picked out Di Maria, who slotted the ball into the net with his left foot.\n\nSwitzerland nearly grabbed an equaliser at the death when Blerim Dzemaili’s header cannoned off the foot of the post, and he pushed the rebound wide.\n\nIt was a cruel result for the Swiss, but they gave their coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who is quitting football, a memorable swan song. Hitzfeld had learned of his brother’s death before the match.\n\nMATCH REPORT: Argentina v Switzerland \n\nLIVE UPDATES\n\n","byline":"SAM CLENCH ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/World Cup/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports Football News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/World Cup/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/World Cup/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/World Cup/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/World Cup/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Football/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/football/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/news.com.au/sport/football/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/football/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/football/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T19:45:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T23:55:49.000Z","description":"LIVE coverage of the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.

American cops epic falcon"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"Depending on your worldview, the film is either really, really romantic or really, really depressing - but did you know star Rachel McAdams nailed her role from the get-go?\n\nMcAdams’ first taped audition for the role of headstrong, lovestruck Allie Hamilton has, in the ensuing years, racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube — when you watch it, you’ll see why they couldn’t cast anyone else in the part:\n\nThrow in The Gosling and you’ve got yourself a hit. \n\nHere are some of the other most memorable celebrity audition tapes:\n\nWhile Johansson wasn’t successful with this audition — she lost out to Kirsten Dunst for the 1995 family film — it still provides a rare, small glimpse at her life as a child actor, some six years before her breakout role as a surly teen in the 2001 cult classic Ghost World.\n\nTHIS KID. Barely 10 years old, actor Henry Thomas’ audition for the role of Elliott Taylor is absolutely heartbreaking. Tears welling in his eyes, the young actor pleads that his extraterrestrial friend not be taken away by the government. In the final seconds of the audition tape, Steven Spielberg can be heard off camera saying the immortal words: “OK kid, you got the job.”\n\nOK, we don’t speak French and there are no subtitles on this clip. But check out Tautou’s adorably wide-eyed performance and try telling us there was anyone else who could’ve played Amelie so perfectly.\n\nThe audition tape as webcam confessional? Nailed it, Stone.\n\nSteve Carell’s first go at inept weatherman Brick Tamland is positively deranged: the poor guy goes as red as a tomato during this two-minute skit with Will Ferrell. Absolutely hilarious.\n\nSeth Rogen’s reputation as Hollywood’s most lovable stoner dates right back to his first audition for Freaks & Geeks, when he was still a teenager. One quibble: Rogen keeps a straight face through his very funny monologue. Where’s that bear-like laugh, Seth!\n\nPage had a few big movies under her belt at this point - Hard Candy and X Men among them - but Juno remains her most memorable role, and it’s not hard to see why: she plays the acerbic, fast-talking teen to perfection, even in this early screen test.\n\nTwenty years on, check out the audition that landed a then-13-year-old Portman her first film role, in the 1994 movie Leon: The Professional. \n\nAs Lea Michele tells it in the clip above, her first Glee audition went “terribly”. Girl, please. As you can see, she had them eating out of the palm of her hand — she was Rachel Berry, even stopping to chastise the auditioners for laughing in the wrong places during her performance.\n\nUmm, Megan Fox is very pretty. She looks very pretty in this audition. And that’s all we’re going to say about that. *sips tea*\n\n*Special mention must also go to Rose Byrne’s spectacularly foul-mouthed audition for Get Him to the Greek, surely one of the funniest (and filthiest) comedy auditions of recent years. Language warning on that link, obviously.\n\n","byline":"Nick Bond ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/Movies/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/movies/","/section/couriermail.com.au/entertainment/","/section/couriermail.com.au/entertainment/movies/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/movies/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/movies/","/section/perthnow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/perthnow.com.au/entertainment/movies/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T06:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T06:01:08.000Z","description":"HOLLYWOOD romance weepie The Notebook celebrated its 10th anniversary the other day.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fni0bom1-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fnihm796-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-e6frfmvr-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fni0bom0-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fni0bom2-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fnhofbao-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"48de5d2367e47f865bba62f80839d58d","keywords":["Ellen Page","Lea Michele","child actor","Language warning","foul-mouthed audition","Hollywood","California","United States of America","webcam confessional","Hard Candy","extraterrestrial friend","Freaks &amp; Geeks","young actor","Steven Spielberg","immortal words","funniest celebrity","breakout role","audition tape","film role","comedy auditions","Nick Bond","adorable child stars","cult classic","lovable stoner dates","family film","Megan Fox","Natalie Portman","Will Ferrell","Audrey Tautou","Rachel Berry","Elliott Taylor","Rachel McAdams","Henry Thomas","Rose Byrne","Emily Jean Stone","Steve Carell"],"kicker":"First tapes","link":"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-best-and-funniest-celebrity-audition-tapes/story-fni0bom0-1226975174250?sv=23a873c25051f1aa106bed0152df087b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975174250","originalAssetId":"1226975174250","originalSource":"NewsComAu","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Movies/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"b277bc9bf68ac05801fc38988eddd031","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975174144","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"HOW did Emma Stone get her big break?

Most managers detest the process as well.”\n\nBut with no way around them, here’s his tips on how to avoid the most common mistakes people make at their performance reviews:\n\nMistake # 1 — Leaving everything up to the boss\n\nMr Hill said a major faux-pas most managers make is leaving all performance-related feedback, pay rises and talk of promotions until the annual review and lumping them all in together in a chat designed to cover everything but actually covering nothing well.\n\nInstead, the best reviews occur when both parties are invested in the conversation.\n\n“Instead of sitting back and hating the process, jump in and take control of your end. Look at this hour of your manger’s time as an opportunity to discuss your career and some key projects. Start the process by turning up well prepared and with a proactive intent; you’ll get much better results if you do.”\n\nHow you attack it depends on how your company handles the process. If it’s designed to talk about working conditions and pay — tell them what you want. Your manager can’t help you if they don’t know. It’s also a good way of ensuring your goals are in writing if your boss happens to move on.\n\nBut while it’s tempting to blurt out everything you want at once, Mr Hill said it’s actually better for employees to separate conversations about pay and working conditions from the review entirely and schedule another meeting to discuss these things.\n\n“I actually think it’s a bad strategy to ask for a pay rise at a performance review. You really should be putting that into a secondary request rather than just lumping it in as a process otherwise the really important stuff can get lost in the process,” he said.\n\nMistake # 2 — Whining about everything \n\nMr Hill said when it comes to making things happen, “attitude trumps policy every single time.”\n\nHaving a professional attitude with clear goals can mean the difference between getting what you want and not. There’s no sense sulking, getting angry or dwelling on the past.\n\n“The most cumbersome performance review can turn into a worthwhile discussion, yet the most transparent, fair system can quickly turn into WWIII if the parties decide war is inevitable. Approaching the process in the right energy state; you’ll be amazed at what a different conversation might occur,” he said.\n\nMistake # 3 — Getting bogged down in the detail\n\nReviews are all about the big picture — don’t get bogged down in detail over who should empty the dishwasher and what time exactly you sent that email.\n\nMr Hill said given you might only get the chance to sit down with your boss once or twice a year, keep things focused on the wider context.\n\nMistake # 4 — Focusing on the negatives\n\nBring me solutions, not problems, is a common business mantra for good reason. Mr Hill said most managers will tell you one of their biggest bugbears is employees who bring problems to the table.\n\n“Sure, this is a good time to bring up things that aren’t working or are holding you back in your work, but rather than dump them on your boss, give them your ideas on fixing the problems at the same time. Again, this isn’t just a process for your boss alone, the best performance reviews are when responsibility is shared.”\n\nMistake # 5 — Assuming you’re on the same page \n\nBad lines of communication are an unfortunate reality for plenty of businesses. If you’re laying out a new strategy in your review make sure you’re clear on what success looks like. That way, you won’t go off on a tangent and waste your time.\n\n“Generally [mistakes happen] because we assumed understanding rather than checked. Especially on the big stuff — big projects and strategy — we need to reflect our approach back to the boss to ensure it’s in keeping with what they had in mind. It’ll save you a lot of time and effort if you do.”\n\nWhat about the managers? \n\nMr Hill said all the managers out there should take note the biggest mistake they can make is focusing on the past rather than the future. Treat it like a ‘preview’ rather than a ‘review’ he said — no one wants to be graded like a school report card.\n\n“Most performance reviews make people happy or sad but actually don’t make them any better at their job. That’s the major issue — they should be previews rather than reviews”\n\nThe other common mistake made by managers is falling into the “lazy trap” of giving feedback only at review time.\n\n“In high performing cultures feedback is a daily process.

Turns out it’s not all that common:\n\nR&B pop duo Milli Vanilli\n\nIn 1990, pop duo Milli Vanilli (a.k.a Fabrice Morvan and Rob Pilatus) ­won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist for their album Girl You Know It’s True. It was later revealed that the only roles the pair had played in the creation of the hit album were appearing on the cover and lip-synching along to studio musicians in the video.\n\nThe duo was stripped of the award and eventually disappeared from the spotlight.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus was nominated for Best Song Written for a Soundtrack at the Grammys in 2009. The nod was for her hit song The Climb from Hannah Montana: The Movie, but she was disqualified just days after being nominated because the song was not originally penned for the film.\n\nThe Climb, while performed by a then-17-year-old Cyrus, was actually written by Jon Mabe and Jessi Alexander, who shopped the number around to other country music artists before it landed in Cyrus’s movie.\n\nAlone Yet Not Alone\n\nSmall budget Christian movie Alone Yet Not Alone made headlines earlier this year when it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song and later disqualified.\n\nThe film, which will be released on June 13, had the nomination yanked by the Motion Picture Academy after it discovered composer Bruce Broughton violated the rules by emailing voters and asking them to give it a listen.\n\nRihanna\n\nNow, this one is awkward. Chris Brown won a total of five awards at the BET Awards in 2011 but one was accidentally awarded to ex-girlfriend Rihanna.\n\nLuckily, RiRi wasn’t present to accept the award and Drake accepted it on her behalf. At the end of the show, host Kevin Hart announced that Brown had actually won the award.\n\nKelsey Martinovich\n\nWhen Kelsey Martinovich was crowned Australia’s Next Top Model, it was a live-TV stuff-up of the highest order.\n\nThe trouble with Kelsey’s win, you might remember, is that host Sarah Murdoch had actually named the wrong girl. It was the other beautiful finalist, Amanda Ware, who’d earned the title.\n\n“I feel sick,” Murdoch said upon realising the gaffe.\n\nWhile Martinovich’s reign only lasted a few fleeting moments, at least the cringiness of the situation made us feel like we were enduring it in slow motion.\n\n","byline":"CHARLOTTE WILLIS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/Awards/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/","/section/couriermail.com.au/entertainment/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/awards/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/perthnow.com.au/entertainment/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T09:11:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T09:12:20.000Z","description":"THE inevitable has been confirmed for disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, who was officially stripped of his ARIA Hall of Fame induction on Tuesday.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84dj3-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84diz-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnil5php-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84de0-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84dj2-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84ddw-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"fe1592f3a671246e8e9e51efadc69a6e","keywords":["fleeting moments","ignoble list","Australia","Know It AB","MTV","Rolf Harris","Motion Picture Academy","Kevin Hart","Bruce Broughton","Sarah Murdoch","rolf harris","aria","award","stripped","artists","singers","grammys","taken away","disgraced entertainer","Christian flick","pop duo","back awards","country music artists","studio musicians","Jessi Alexander","Jon Mabe","Miley Cyrus","Robert Pilatus","Kelsey Martinovich","Rob Pilatus"],"kicker":"Rolf ARIA","link":"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/fall-from-grace-celebrities-who-have-been-stripped-of-their-awards/story-fnk84de0-1226975573300?sv=9fe79edd754891fa3d0e2807d35b3e42","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975573300","originalSource":"NewsComAu","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Awards/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"3cc8b8229387eca588593335463fb3b0","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975573511","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"DISGRACED entertainer Rolf Harris has rightly been stripped of his ARIA Hall of Fame induction.

Wait till you read these. As a community service, we present to you the most damning reviews ofMichael Bay’s Transformers: Age of Extinction:\n\n“The urine you discharge during the inevitable pi** break is guaranteed to flow better than any dialogue in this near three-hour movie.” Digital Spy.\n\n“If I could ask (Michael) Bay one question, it would be: Why can’t you make a better movie? At the end, I wished I could make a citizen’s arrest for assault with intent to bore to death.” Boston Herald.\n\n“Bay has said that this film will kick off a second trilogy of Transformers movies — and I think he’s serious. That means there will be (at least) two more of these things. God help us all.” Entertainment Weekly\n\n“Even by the low IQ standards of the three previous Transformers films, Transformers: Age of Extinction is grave and exceptionally stupid, with a plot as bewildering and incoherent as a caffeinated 5-year-old’s explanation of the multiverse theory.” The Blade.\n\n“This tepid fourth instalment is actually an improvement over 2011’s ridiculous Dark of the Moon entry. But that’s like saying the flu is better than pneumonia.” Us Weekly.\n\n“Sitting through Transformers: Age of Extinction is like binge-watching the death of the human spirit. It is a crushing and relentless experience, one where even the comedic relief bits are nihilistically hateful.” Badass Digest\n\n“Transformers: Age of Extinction also has appalling dialogue (“My face is a warrant!” says James Nesbitt lookalike Titus Welliver as an FBI agent); exploitative and deplorable representations of women; ridiculous, hard to follow and un-self-aware action sequences; very little humour (unless you count the guffaws) and racial stereotyping. In other words, it’s a Michael Bay movie.” Film Ink.\n\nSo how does director Michael Bay feel about these shocking reviews?\n\n“They love to hate, and I don’t care; let them hate,” Bay said to MTV .\n\n“They’re still going to see the movie! I think it’s good to get a little tension. Very good.”\n\nBut the question remains, if the reviews are SO bad, why is it that so many people are paying money to go and see it?\n\nAccording to Polygon’s  Chris Plante, it’s because Transformers movies are “arguably, universally loved”.\n\n“Some people watch Transformers to reconnect with their childhood, others because it’s a familiar action series that they associate with ‘things we do in the summertime’ and others — and this is on a subconscious level — take pleasure in watching a world like ours, but in which the lines between good and evil are clear, and good triumphs all,” Plante said.\n\nIf you’ve seen Transformers: Age of Extinction let us know what you thought of it in the comments section below. \n\n","byline":"STAFF WRITERS ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment -

He has groomed their families and he has groomed the whole community by creating a character who’s innocent. An affable gentleman,” Bekker, now 50, tells Seven reporter David Richardson.\n\n“That’s what happens. Rolf Harris has become a master of impressions.”\n\nRichardson asked Ms Bekker: “So he’s groomed the world?”\n\nBekker responded: “Absolutely. Yep. You suckers! That’s what he’s done. He’s groomed the world.”\n\nMs Bekker’s exclusive interview with Seven comes as the veteran entertainer was yesterday found guilty of sexually assaulting four teenage school girls over an almost 20-year period with a jury unanimously declaring him guilty on all charges.\n\nMs Bekker recounted the alleged assault in terrifying detail, saying she was staying with her family at the Glenview Motel on Sydney’s north shore when Harris entered the dining room with In The Wild presenter Harry Butler, whom she recognised and was keen to interview for a school project.\n\n“I thought ‘what an unreal opportunity to get to interview Harry Butler’ ... and I thought ‘woo hoo, top marks for this’,” she said on air last night.\n\n“Harry Butler agreed to allow me to interview him and at 14 even though I didn’t really know who he was, that was a pretty cool opportunity. So I left the restaurant with Harry Butler to do an interview and Rolf Harris followed us.\n\n“As soon as we were in the lift Rolf Harris started to touch me. He was basically getting his fingers and tickling my ribs and pinching my bottom and I was very uncomfortable with that.”\n\nMs Bekker claimed that as they stepped out of the lift Harris only got more brazen, following her to her room.\n\n“As I was walking along he had his tummy placed against me and he had reached around my shoulders and he has his hands over my breast. And he was saying like a kind of poem which basically referred to my breasts as ripe plums.\n\n“And then he was saying ‘oh give Rolfy a cuddle. Rolfy deserves a cuddle, give Rolfy a hug’.”\n\nThe then-teenager told Richardson that she was eventually able to flee the room and conduct her interview with Butler, who had no idea what was going on.\n\nRichardson asked: “Looking back now, do you believe you were the first?”\n\nBekker responded: “Absolutely not. His actions were so fluid and quick. He had such a limited time and he just went straight into it and he was absolutely rehearsed ... he’s rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed.”\n\nBekker, who went on to become a youth worker, claimed she tried to lodge a complaint with police in 1984 which went nowhere, resulting in her going “off the rails”.\n\n“Self-hatred, doubts, anger, anger, years and years of anger. I’m still angry ... an angry person,” she said, adding that until this week she hadn’t even told her daughter of the attack.\n\n“You can’t take away what he’s done. There’s no correcting it. I’m 50. This happened when I was 14. There’s no way to fix that. I don’t have a second chance at this. I never had a second chance.”\n\nHarris will be sentenced at the end of this week.\n\n","byline":"CHARLOTTE WILLIS, TV Writer","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/TV/","/display/news.com.au/Entertainment/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/Television/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Entertainment - syndicated/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/television/","/section/couriermail.com.au/entertainment/","/section/couriermail.com.au/entertainment/television/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/","/section/news.com.au/entertainment/tv/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/television/","/section/perthnow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/perthnow.com.au/entertainment/television/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/television/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:30:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T14:32:55.000Z","description":"SEVEN women gave evidence as witnesses of groping incidents involving Rolf Harris during his sex abuse trial.

The delay was so long that one of her opponents, Kristina Barrois, asked the umpire whether she could warm up again.\n\nThe match eventually started, but Williams was still struggling. In the third game, she was broken to love after serving four double-faults. One of the best servers in the history of women’s tennis hit balls that bounced before reaching the net.\n\nWith the score at 0-40 in that game, umpire Kader Nouni climbed down from his chair and asked Williams whether she would able to continue. One point later, she walked to the side of the court holding hands with her doubles partner (and sister) Venus, ready to end the match.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Miss Williams has to retire,” Nouni announced to the crowd. Williams wiped away tears as she trudged towards the exit.\n\nAccording to the referee’s office, Williams’ withdrawal was due to a viral illness.\n\n“I am heartbroken I’m not able to continue in the tournament,” she said in a statement afterwards. “I thought I could rally this morning because I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.”\n\nVenus Williams confirmed her sister was sick.\n\n“Unfortunately, Serena has been feeling unwell for the past few days and she just couldn’t play to her potential today,” she said. “I’m really proud of her for trying because we just love playing doubles together.”\n\nVenus and Serena have won 13 Grand Slam doubles titles as a pair, including five at Wimbledon. In singles, 32-year-old Serena is the world number one, and has claimed 17 major championships.\n\n“We were all looking forward to a great match. From the bottom of my heart, I thank all of the fans for their cheers and understanding,” she said. “I look forward to returning to Wimbledon next year.”\n\n","byline":"HOWARD FENRICH and STAFF

the dirty truth about what germs are lurking on planes and in airports.\n\nTaking three different flights across the country, each on a different major airline, their team gathered samples from various stages of the journey including check-in, armrests and toilets with some concerning results.\n\nThe first shock — security screening.\n\nTests of two bins used to collect shoes, bags and other personal belongings that go through the x-ray machine revealed the presence of dangerous bacteria. One bin was found to have foecal matter at levels high enough to make people sick.\n\nDr. Robert Glatter, an emergency doctor at New York’s Lenox Hill Hospital told the show: “We’re talking about skin or soft-tissue infections, which can potentially lead to overwhelming infections in your bloodstream”.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning.\n\nOnce on the plane, the germ situation isn’t any more comforting. Crumbs on the aisle floors and mysterious stains on the seats had the team questioning how thorough the cleaners were between flights.\n\nThe most shocking find was the levels of bacteria found on the tray tables. Covered in germs, one flight attendant recalled seeing them being used as change tables for babies nappies.\n\nWhile all the armrests came back negative, tests on the seat belts were filthy including one that showed the presence of “human bacteroides”.\n\n“These are bacteria that live in our gut and our intestines. These are dangerous bacteria that cause serious infections”, said Glatter.\n\nAnother study conducted by Auburn University found that harmful and potentially deadly bacteria like MRSA and E. coli survive for days on arm rests, toilet flush handles, tray tables, window shades, seats and seat pockets.\n\nSo how can you prevent picking up one of these dreaded bugs on a plane?\n\nCarry sanitiser and wipe down your tray table before use, wash your hands frequently, don’t walk barefoot on the carpet and check the back seat pocket before use for any nasty leftovers from the previous flight.\n\n","byline":"ROWENA RYAN, Travel Reporter ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Travel -

They met on a beach where the dogs fought to the death, with the carcass of the losing animal thrown into the ocean.\n\n“They are very, very brutal,” she said.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are the more organised groups, whose members call themselves “gentlemen fighters”.\n\n“The gentlemen fighters look after their dogs, as such. They’re well-fed, kennelled, they always have water. When you can see there’s a loser, the fight stops,” the campaigner said.\n\n“They see it as a sport, as such — but I see no difference.”\n\nShe said ring leaders used long, flat “break sticks” to pry open dogs’ jaws, they trained the dogs on treadmills, and administered steroids to the animals to pump them up for fights. Owners also conduct their own surgery to patch up their injured fighters, to evade the suspicion of vets.\n\nAmerican Staffordshire terriers are popular breeds to use in dog fights, as are agile pitbulls.\n\n“They’re the most loving dogs. All they want to do is please,” the campaigner said.\n\nThe RSPCA website says there are “many” dog fighting rings across the country.\n\n“These (rings) are often associated with gambling activities and other illegal practices, such as drug dealing and firearms,” the site states. “Dogs … are often specifically bred for fighting and are trained to be extremely aggressive towards other dogs.”\n\nRSPCA Victoria told news.com.au that it had received reports of dog fighting in Melbourne.\n\n“Dog fighting is most often linked with organised crime and, as an underground activity, it is difficult to locate and investigate,” inspectorate manager Allie Jalbert said.\n\n“As such, complaints to RSPCA Victoria regarding dog fighting have been minimal and investigations have not resulted in sufficient evidence to substantiate cruelty charges in recent years.”\n\nThe Queenland anti-dog-fighting campaigner asked for anonymity in this story so she could continue to gather evidence against participants.\n\nShe tracks their activities by befriending people on Facebook, and then shares what information she gathers with the RSPCA. She said she had passed on names of suspected dog fighters in the Hunter Valley previously.\n\nShe also tracks dog fighters in the US.\n\n“My evidence has been responsible for a few busts,” she said.\n\nA police spokesman said the Port Stephens Local Area Command, which looks after Oyster Cove, had not received any reports of dog fighting in the area, either formally or anecdotally.\n\nAn RSCPA NSW spokesman for the area said he was not aware of any dog fighting, but said he would investigate the Oyster Cove report.\n\n“We hear the odd rumour but we’ve never been able to get any evidence,” he said.\n\nHe encouraged those who may have any details about it to inform the RSCPA through its website.\n\nDo you know more?

More than 700 people went missing between 2005 and 2008, presumed killed by the squad.\n\nMr Duterte has never publicly endorsed the squad’s behaviours, but his public comments about cleaning up the streets appear to condone its violent activities.\n\n“If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, if you are a criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, for as long as I am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination,” Mr Duterte said in 2009.\n\nIn a 2012 press conference, Mr Duterte offered a $120,000 reward for whoever could bring him the decapitated head of an alleged gang leader, the Daily Mail reports. He offered an extra $24,000 if the head could be brought in a bag of ice, “so it won’t smell so bad”.\n\nHis war against rice smugglers raised eyebrows internationally in February when he told a Senate committee that he would “gladly kill” an accused smuggler.\n\n“I want smuggling of rice in my city stopped,” he said at an earlier press conference. “But if you still do not stop your smuggling activities, I will kill you.”\n\nHe has also issued a shoot-to-kill order against any lawless elements in Davao City and instructed security forces to shoot any looters after Typhoon Haiyan hit last year.\n\nDavao is the world’s largest city in terms of land area, with a population over 1.5 million, but international database numbeo.com has named it the world’s “fourth safest place”.\n\nDespite this, human rights advocates, including Amnesty, have slammed Mr Duterte’s take-no-prisoners response to the city’s crime.\n\nCommission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales said Mr Duterte’s threats were “sending the wrong signals that invite vigilantism”, according to Rappler.\n\n“Simply put, ordering law enforcement officers to ‘shoot to kill’ suspects, or threatening smugglers to leave your area out of their operations or ‘I will kill you’, is no way for a local chief executive to lead,” she said.\n\nBut Mr Duterte has always been unapologetic about his methods.\n\n“I admit I am 100 per cent terrorist but I am terrorising only the drug pushers, kidnappers, hold-up gangs and other criminals,” he said on TV in 2003. “Kidnappers, drug pushers from other places, I dare you to come over here so that I can finish you off.”\n\nThousands of residents staged a mobilization here in Davao City to urge Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to run for president. pic.twitter.com/oyzgdAuKsj\n\n— karlos manlupig (@karlosmanlupig) March 29, 2014 \n\nNow, there is a legion of supporters who are keen to see Mr Duterte become the country’s next president.\n\nIn March, thousands turned up to Davao City’s Rizal Park to push him to run to replace President Benigno Aquino III, who steps down in 2016, Rappler reports.\n\nThe Pilipinas 2016 Duterte Movement has collected more than four million signatures and leader Mar Masanguid has described him as an “iron-fisted leader with heart”.\n\nMr Duterte has always rejected suggestions that he run for president, but that has not stopped this grassroots movement.\n\n","byline":"JAMES LAW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network

Welsh sculptress has shuffled into the room to be helped into the same front row seat almost every day for seven weeks.\n\nOne can only imagine what has been going through her mind as day after day, week after week, the secret life of her husband Rolf Harris was laid bare in the most graphic of detail.\n\nNothing was sacred: from the size of his penis, to sexual affairs and his long-held and sick desire for little girls in bikinis.\n\nAnd with the guilty verdict, Welsh sculptress Alwen Hughes joined an unenviable wives club, the unwitting spouses of shamed sex offender husbands.\n\nVICTIMS HAPPY: Tonya Lee “excited” as Rolf’s brother “badgers” witness \n\nJURY NOT TOLD: The other harassment claims against Rolf Harris \n\nROLF HARRIS: How the predator was treated in the UK press \n\nEven after his questioning by police Alwen remained steadfast by his side, similar to Robyn Gardiner, the celebrity agent wife of Aussie TV star Robert Hughes of Hey Dad! fame, who stood by her man even after he was charged with sexually abusing four girls over a 20-year period.\n\nGardiner didn’t attend court in May when the 65-year-old was sentenced to six years jail, but that was not, her lawyer said, because she no longer supported him, but to avoid the media.\n\n“We knew it was going to be a difficult day and we didn’t want her to be under any more stress,” lawyer Greg Walsh said of Gardiner. “We appreciated members of the media would perceive it as being a lack of support for Robert but that was not the case.”\n\nGardiner and Hughes appear to be standing beside their husbands even after they are found guilty.\n\nNot so the wife of British celebrity publicist Max Clifford, 71. His wife of four years Jo divorced him in a hearing lasting less than two minutes after he was jailed this year for eight years for indecent assault of four women.\n\nIn the divorce proceedings when asked about the grounds for divorce she declared “unreasonable behaviour” and said it affected her health.\n\n“I suffered from stress and heart palpitations and saw a specialist,” she declared.\n\n","byline":"By CHARLES MIRANDA in London ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/World/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Network

I wanted everyone to know what happened.\n\n“I want to work with people who’ve been in situations like mine.\n\n“I don’t care how much money he’s got ... I couldn’t care less, the bottom line is he abuses children.”\n\nPROTECTORS SLAMMED: Harris ‘a classic example of a molester’ \n\nGROPED: Australian woman ‘indecently assaulted by Harris’ \n\nAfter Lee spoke of her reaction to Harris’s guilty verdict, Cathy Henkel, who was caring for Lee at the time when Harris abused her, told of how she was saddened by the verdict, even though it was the right decision.\n\nHenkel, a former friend of Harris for the past 40 years, told ABC 730 tonight that the verdict did not surprise her.\n\n“I wasn’t surprised, I think it’s the right decision, but I think it’s just a very sad day,” she said.\n\n“I still remember what a wonderful man he was...I do believe the girls, and believe the verdict is the right one, so it’s very confusing.”\n\nHenkel, who met Harris while working as a waitress in South Africa, said she found testifying against him for the prosecution a “really unpleasant experience”.\n\nBut she said she was pleased to testify on behalf of Lee who was in her care at the time.\n\nWhen asked to recall the night where Harris had assaulted Lee, Henkel said she had a “flash memory” of Lee sitting on Harris’s lap. But she did not think anything of it at the time.\n\n“It did not occur to me he had done anything inappropriate to her,” Henkel said.\n\nHenkel also spoke of how Harris’s brother Bruce contacted her after he found out about the incidents.\n\nWhen asked if she thought Bruce was trying to get her to downplay her testimony, she said: “I think he called me thinking who else can I speak to.\n\n“He did badger me a little bit, in the sense of asking me repeatedly ‘it couldn’t have happened’, ‘you must be able to say it couldn’t have happened’.\n\n“But I couldn’t say that because the circumstances were there. I mean I didn’t see it happen, but I couldn’t say it didn’t happen, and so I did feel pressured by that and eventually I had to say, sorry, I can’t say it didn’t happen.”\n\nROLF HARRIS KICKED OUT OF ARIA HALL OF FAME\n\nRolf Harris has been kicked out of the ARIA Hall of Fame and will most likely be stripped of his Order of Australia after being convicted of sexual abuse.\n\nThe 84-year-old entertainer is facing spending the rest of his life behind bars after being convicted by a London court of 12 counts of indecent assault against four girls — one as young as seven.\n\nPolice are now reportedly considering fresh allegations of sex abuse in Australia and Britain.\n\nIn New Zealand, police are checking with Scotland Yard if any more complaints have been made against Harris.\n\nDuring his trial, seven women including a New Zealander and several Australians, gave evidence as witnesses of groping incidents involving Harris.\n\nWith the original case now closed, he will likely face further charges relating to the witness claims and fresh complaints from women now willing to come forward.\n\nIt has also been reported that convicted pedophile Harris was once shown around Broadmoor Hospital by notorious sex predator Jimmy Savile, with a former patient describing the pair as “birds of a feather”.\n\nAlison Pink — who said disgraced entertainer Savile abused her at Broadmoor — told the Mirror the pair suddenly turned up on a women’s ward just as patients were preparing to get undressed. \n\nHELL AWAITS: The grim prison reality facing Rolf Harris \n\nPREDATOR: Rolf Harris doomed by his own writings \n\nCHILLING VIDEO: When Rolf told kids to say no \n\nThe ARIA board met today after the guilty verdict and quickly decided to eject Harris from their honour roll which stretches from Dame Joan Sutherland to Kylie Minogue.\n\nPerth-born Harris was inducted in 2008 during a ceremony at the Melbourne Town Hall and joined onstage by The Seekers to perform Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport and Jake The Peg.\n\nARIA chief executive Dan Rosen said the board had decided to withdraw the award following Harris’s conviction.\n\nIn Harris’s home city of Perth, a footpath plaque honouring the disgraced entertainer is being removed, while his boyhood school has already decided to pull down his paintings.\n\nHarris was appointed an Officer of the order of Australia in 2012 for distinguished service to arts, charitable organisations and international relations.\n\nHe also became a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989, received the Centenary Medal in 2001 and has two levels of awards under the Order of the British Empire.\n\nThe Governor-General can strip recipients of their awards if they’ve been convicted of a crime under Australian or foreign law.\n\nBut a spokeswoman for Government House told AAP they wouldn’t comment on individual cases of possible or actual honours cancellations.\n\nThe Order of Australia council considers cases brought to its attention and can recommend cancellations to the Governor-General.\n\nDuring his eight-week trial, prosecutors described Harris — who charmed audiences in Britain and Australia during his 60-year career — as a Jekyll and Hyde character with a self-confessed “dark side”.\n\nThe Southwark Crown Court heard he acted in “in plain sight and without fear of consequences”.\n\nHis victims included his daughter Bindi’s 13-year-old friend, who he groomed during years of sexual abuse.\n\nHe even assaulted the girl — who told the court she was transformed from a happy child into a depressed alcoholic as a result of Harris’s abuse — as his daughter was sleeping just metres away, the court heard.\n\nThe other victims told the court how they were groped and assaulted by Harris, some at public appearances.\n\nOne victim was indecently assaulted by Harris at the age of seven after she asked him for an autograph at a hall in Southampton.\n\nNew Zealand police have declined to comment on whether the New Zealand woman who gave evidence in the London court case had sought support from New Zealand authorities.\n\nKnown only as MC, the woman gave evidence that she met Harris as a 16-year-old in 1970 at a private cocktail party at a restaurant called the Chelsea Rooms somewhere in the North Island.\n\nWhile dancing together, Harris allegedly put his hand on her bottom over her dress, then put his hands up the front of her dress to her crotch.\n\nShe told the court she saw the “dark side” of a man she thought she could trust.\n\nHarris sat motionless and expressionless as the verdicts were read out and left the court supported by his wife Alwen and daughter.\n\nHe will be sentenced on Friday.\n\nThe disgraced entertainer could face years behind bars in London’s Wandsworth Prison as three of the 12 counts carry a possible ten-year sentence.\n\n","byline":"Network Writers

Footage showed not only had Harris partaken but he captained the team and did a large televised painting at the event — all of which occurred at Cambridge.\n\nThe dramatic discovery of the 1978 TV footage disrupted the trial as the jury, which did not know then of the footage discovery, had to be retired to allow legal parties to argue for their respective inclusion and exclusion.\n\nDefence lawyers knew its inclusion would go to the heart of their client’s credibility in the eyes of the jury since he was so sure on the stand of his evidence, with no-one at that point able to contradict.\n\nHis defence on that indictment — groping the 14-year-old on the buttocks in what she thought was about 1976 — revolved about his denial of the event and city. They tried unsuccessfully to have the footage blocked from inclusion on the grounds of fairness and prejudice and said their defence would have been different if the 1978 footage was known about.\n\nBoth prosecution and defence said it was not an ideal situation for either side but Justice Nigel Sweeney agreed while the case was at a sensitive stage he accepted the prosecution’s argument and allowed the footage to be shown.\n\nHarris attempted to counter and said that he did not remember being on the program but accepted he was there but did not realise it was Cambridge and added no celebrities probably realised it was that city since they all just got bussed around the country and that was the nature of show business.\n\nHe repeatedly denied lying or tailoring his evidence to suit the evidence presented but the damage was done.\n\n","byline":"By CHARLES MIRANDA in London ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:58:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T23:00:09.000Z","description":"A MONTH into his trial, the prosecution case had finished presenting its case and Rolf Harris had been on the stand for four days when the entertainer was hit with his ‘gotcha’ moment.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/rolf-harris-case-the-turning-point-in-his-trial-was-when-the-jury-saw-him-in-star-games-footage/story-fnhocwho-1226974674194?sv=c27e9bd1e6425a28e4d200c264b6a27","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["perthnow.com.au"],"id":"eefed3c49a04c7d0ed7f2e945da26535","keywords":["dramatic discovery","point able","gotcha moment","show business","turning point","Florida","United States of America","celebrity sports contest","London","United Kingdom","legal parties","ideal situation","footage discovery","Getty Images Inc.","Rolf Harris","Tonya Lee","witness stand"],"kicker":"Credibility gone","link":"http://www.news.com.au/news/rolf-harris-case-the-turning-point-in-his-trial-was-when-the-jury-saw-him-in-star-games-footage/story-fnhocwho-1226974674194?sv=c27e9bd1e6425a28e4d200c264b6a27","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974674194","originalAssetId":"1226974339277","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"07644d1571d878f79292e1c10b6c0d6e","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"hubXhrbjqM9rCeXwqOoSPENjO_DPee4m","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A MONTH into his trial, Rolf Harris was on the stand for four days when he was hit with his “gotcha” moment.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Rolf Harris case: the turning point in his trial was when the jury saw him in Star Games footage ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["-"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Gotcha!

That statistic is simply breathtaking — especially against nine-time French Open champion Nadal.\n\nFaced with the most ferocious grand slam competitor in the world, Kyrgios did not lose a single first serve point, winning all 19 while gunning down 13 aces and thumping 22 clean winners.\n\nAnd he was able to maintain momentum despite Nadal using every piece of his devastating artillery.\n\nImpossibly laid back, Kyrgios seized the ascendancy by blasting drives past frustrated Nadal.\n\nUnfazed at letting slip a set point on Nadal’s serve in the 12th game, Kyrgios romped through the tiebreak after surging to a 4-0 lead.\n\nMaintaining incredible serving levels, the teenager produced the shot of the tournament midway through the second set, with a half-volley winner — played off a bare baseliner and between the legs.\n\nIn control, he will long rue a sloppy service game at 6-5.\n\nDespite holding game points, he dropped serve for the first time in the match — and the set.\n\nNadal’s relief was palpable as the Spanish bull jabbed his fist in delight. It had taken him 95 minutes to create the first crack in Kyrgios’s arsenal.\n\nNo player in international tennis saps energy from opponent like Nadal. Impressively, Kyrgios continued to trade heavyweight blows with the world champion.\n\nAnd when the tyro twice survived serving crisis deep in the third set before unleashing a monster forehand return Nadal could only push wide to lose the tiebreak, centre court erupted.\n\nKrygios’s father George and sister Halimah jumped to their feet in jubilation as he grabbed the third set with classic stand-and-deliver missile.\n\nMore assured with every exchange, Kyrgios pressured Nadal into unforced forehand error in the fourth game of the fourth set as the prospect of miracle victory became reality.\n\nServing for the match, Kyrgios didn’t blink, sealing the issue with an ace.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink in London

the UK between 1968 and 1986.\n\nPerth Lord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi said councillors would vote on whether to rip-up the plaque honouring Harris on St Georges Terrace at a council meeting on July 15.\n\nMs Scaffidi said she supported the removal of the plaque, laid in 1989 outside the Bankwest tower, but an absolute majority of votes was needed.\n\n“(It’s a) sad day for Perth. It’s an impact on the Australian and Perth brand,” she said.\n\n“Obviously one of our own has now come to blows in terms of the verdicts and will probably spend the rest of his days in jail.\n\n“This is not the kind of story we like to have associated with our city.”\n\nEdith Cowan University Vice-Chancellor Professor Kerry Cox said the University Council would decide on whether to strip Harris of his honorary doctorate next month.\n\n“The verdict concerning Rolf Harris became available today,” he said.\n\n“It is important to ECU that the personal values of our award recipients are congruent with Edith Cowan University’s values.\n\n“Works of art by Rolf Harris have been removed from display because it is my judgement it is what the University community would want me to do and it is what I believe is the right course of action.\n\n“Honorary doctorates are awarded and rescinded only by the University Council. The Council meets next in August.”\n\nA West Australian Education Department spokeswoman said that several Harris artworks would be removed from the walls of Perth Modern School, where he was a student from 1943 to 1947.\n\n“The Department of Education has confirmed that Perth Modern School will be removing all artwork by Rolf Harris from display in the wake of a guilty verdict on charges of indecent assault.”\n\nShe said the paintings would need to be professionally removed over coming days and the school’s board would meet to decide what to do with them.\n\nThe paintings, which were kept at the school on display until the conclusion of the trial, will now be archived.\n\nTwo local councils are considering what to do with monuments honouring “The Boy from Bassendean”.\n\nEarlier today, Mrs Scaffidi said the council would likely tear up St Georges Terrace plaque that commemorates Harris.\n\n“We’ll consider the removal, most likely, of the plaque,” she told 6PR.\n\nThe council would first ask for the views of committee that selected him for a plaque, she said.\n\n“I can’t say until the council decision is made but the general feeling around the place is that we don’t accept those kind of offences,” Ms Scaffidi said.\n\nMrs Scaffidi said her personal opinion was to remove the St Georges Terrace plaque.\n\n“It’s a very sad issue and something we need to deal with.”\n\nBASSENDEAN SHUNS DISGRACED ROLF\n\nAnd the Town of Bassendean will consider at a special meeting on Thursday whether to remove Harris’ status as a freeman of the town.\n\nBassendean Mayor John Gangell wants Harris stripped of his Freemanship — and for all of the entertainer’s paintings in the council chamber to be removed.\n\nMr Gangell said a special council meeting had been called for Thursday for the town’s councillors to vote on the issue.\n\nA plaque near Harris’ home on Bassendean Parade would also be pulled up if the move is backed by a majority of councillors.\n\n“My view, and what I will be urging the council, is to strip him of his Freemanship and also to remove all artworks that the Town of Bassendean has displayed,” Mr Gangell said.\n\n“The crime in which he has been convicted are heinous and cannot be condoned, regardless of who he is or what he is.\n\n“It’s a sad day, obviously, and there will be a lot of shock in the community. There was always a possibility of this verdict, but nevertheless it’s a shock to hear the verdict.”\n\n“It is quite disheartening to have to do that but due to the seriousness of the crimes . . . you just simply can’t proceed in any other way.\n\n“It’s something that we must do now to distance ourself.”\n\nHarris is one of only six freemen of Bassendean, Mr Gangell said.\n\nA photo portrait of Harris was removed from Bassendean’s council chambers in May.\n\nMr Gangell said Harris had been “the hero of the town”, so his conviction came as a shock.\n\n“Unfortunately that world stage that he’s put Bassendean on has now come crashing down.\n\n“And we simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he’s been convicted.”\n\nDeputy Mayor Mike Lewis agreed Harris should lose his Freeman honour, but believes his artwork should remain on show in the council chamber.\n\n“I still think it should be on show because I think his art is something quite different,” Mr Lewis.\n\n“I personally feel it’s abhorrent what he’s actually done, but I still feel the art is a different story altogether.\n\n“Our town is being amalgamated in the next 12 months anyway, so even if we do have it there, after the amalgamation in a year’s time there is a good chance those facilities are going to be closed.”\n\nAsked if there was a danger that leaving the paintings up condones Harris’ crimes, Mr Lewis replied: “I suppose there is, but it depends on how you see things.\n\n“If you go back in history where movies made by an American movie producer, the one is not allowed back into America otherwise he’ll be arrested, they don’t ban his movies to be shown in America because it’s quite separate from what the man does.\n\n“I’m still a little bit in two minds but I’m tending along the lines of thinking that art is art and criminal activities are criminal activities.”\n\nAnother Bassendean councillor Anne Brinkworth said: “The artwork as far as I am concerned is done by an artist and I don’t know whether that should be pulled down because of that reason. I haven’t even thought about it enough to be honest.”\n\nShe said Harris’ Freemanship would “probably have to be taken off him”, saying she was still trying to come to terms with his conviction.\n\nBassendean MP Dave Kelly said the removal of Harris’ artwork from display was a matter for the Town of Bassendean.\n\nHowever, the Labor MP said Harris’ victims, as well as other victims of sex abuse, should be at the forefront of councillors’ minds when deciding what action to take.\n\n“Whilst it’s obviously difficult for Rolf’s family, and there will be people who remember him fondly as an entertainer, the people we have to show the most concern for are the victims of these types of crimes,” Mr Kelly said.\n\nHarris is likely to be jailed at his sentencing on Friday.\n\n","byline":"AAP and Peter Law ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/National/","/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network

the crème de la crème of boganism for 7mate’s reality show, Bogan Hunters, and the Apple Isle is certainly punching well above its weight.\n\nAfter an exhaustive process of elimination, celebrity judges Angry Anderson, Jonesy, Miss Nude Australia, Tahir Bilgic, Jacko, Chris Franklin, Derek Boyer and Rob Shehadie have selected seven finalists to go through to next Tuesday’s Bogan Hunters Grand Final.\n\nMore: Do bogans know they’re bogans and other important questions\n\nFenech told news.com.au that only the purest of bogans made it through.\n\n“When we started the series I thought it was a bit of a joke. But boganism is a culture. These guys are unashamedly bogans. They love it, they live it, they have a complete lack of any pretence. I reckon the bogan is the true Aussie battler of the new millennium.”\n\nAnd while they are all unique in their embracement of the “culture”, they all have one thing in common. \n\n“It’s a mystery, the teeth of the bogan,” added Fenech, “a bit like the Bermuda Triangle. Could be too many Beam and Cokes, I don’t know. But I would say more than 50 per cent of bogans do have some pretty interesting teeth, that’s for sure. It could be a money thing. It costs a lot to get your teeth fixed.”\n\nHe says the finalists are defined by: “Mullets, thongs, ugg boots, flannelettes, tight jeans, a love of Oz rock, home done tattoos are important, a lack of pretence is very important, as is a willingness to be incredibly honest at all time.”\n\nAustralia, meet your finalists:\n\nMEL: the kinky chick from Munno Para, South Australia \n\nSaid to perfectly represent the “female of the bogan species”. She once stabbed her partner in the neck with a pair of scissors because he poked her too much in the arm.\n\nANDREW: the dad to eight kids to three different mothers from Bridgewater, Tasmania \n\nHas the name of his eight kids tattooed on his arms, all the girls on one arm and the boys on the other. “I can’t remember their dates of birth cos I’m always too smashed. That way if I go to Centrelink and they ask me, well I can say ‘here we go, here’s the date of birth” he said as he showed off the ink.\n\nDARREN: the second worst driver in Tasmania, also from Bridgewater \n\nHas 52 charges of driving with no licence against his name and is proud of it. Has his own car graveyard full off abandoned wrecks. “What more do you want in life,” he said.\n\nNANNA SHAZZA: the larger-than-life GILF from Victoria’s bogan epicentre, Nar Nar Goon \n\nIs the “odds on favourite” to win. Loves her Holdens, Collingwood football team and exposing her breasts. Enjoys drinking a goon sack of wine hung from a clothesline.\n\nJUSTIN: the young chick magnet from St Helens, Tasmania \n\nIs the youngest bogan of the finalists. Sports a good array of tatts including an “Made in Australia” sign, a Southern Cross and the name of his son across his chest. Became a dad at 16 and is fiercely proud of his mullet which he describes as “nice and filthy”.\n\nFORDY: the wild man from Rocky aka Western Australia’s most bogan suburb, Rockingham \n\nCan swear mid-word, loves a nudie run, Ned Kelly, a barbecue and has an esky of beers kept next to his bed.

the Supreme Court in Brisbane.\n\nTweets by @KateKyriacou \n\n1.15pm: The 75th witness in the trial is psychiatrist Dr Mark Schramm.\n\nHe said he worked chiefly in forensic psychiatry, including in the prison mental health service, but also worked privately.\n\nDr Schramm said he looked at Allison Baden-Clay’s autopsy report, doctor records, as well as psychology consultation notes and records.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay was first diagnosed with relapsing major depression disorder, with features of anxiety, by Dr Tom George in 2003.\n\nDr Schramm said that meant it had a longitudinal course that waxed, waned and recurred upon one of her pregnancies.\n\n“It wasn’t just a single episode it was more than one episode,” he said.\n\nHe said the symptoms of the disorder included a depressed mood, self-doubt, anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nDr Schramm said there was a link between major depression and suicide.\n\n“Studies for the rate of suicide vary … but probably one of the most well-respected studies performed by people who work in Australia or even Brisbane suggests that 3.4 per cent of people who experience depression will take their lives,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not universal for people who took their own lives to leave a note.\n\n“More than half do not,” he said.\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for suicide to be a surprise to loved ones, friends and relatives.\n\n“It is also the case that very often, and unfortunately suicide is a surprise, and even in retrospect it has been impossible to predict,” he said.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nDr Schramm said around half of those who ended their lives had seen a medical professional in the two weeks prior.\n\n“I think it’s folly to assume that simply because you have a medical degree or you are a psychologist or a psychiatrist that you can confidently predict or rule out when someone might kill themselves,” he said.\n\n“It’s human nature to assume that experts have the answers.”\n\nHe said it was not uncommon for experts to “miss” someone who was at risk.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Danny Boyle, Dr Schramm agreed he had not interviewed anyone in relation to his assessment.\n\nHe agreed his opinions were based on medical notes and records.\n\nDr Schramm agreed his remarks were general and related to people who suffered depression.\n\nHe asked the psychiatrist about maternal attachment.\n\n“If someone has a strong attachment to her children and she has a concern as to their wellbeing, an ongoing concern, that would indicate a high level of attachment which would be a protective factor against suicide?” Mr Boyle said.\n\nDr Schramm said it would reduce the risk Ms Baden-Clay would harm herself.\n\n“I accept that is something that goes against the argument that she was suicidal,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked if suicide was likely if there had been no triggering event.\n\n“I’d suggest there could be some triggering events that we don’t know about, some triggering events that are internal, but I accept that knowing there is no triggering event … it is less likely,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed a person making short and long-term plans would make one “less concerned” they would harm themselves.\n\n“A decision may have occurred after such plans, long term or medium term, were made,” he said.\n\nMr Boyle asked about the likely suicide risk of a person who had been proactive in the past about seeking assistance from counsellors and doctors.\n\n“In general I would accept Allison seemed to be someone who put her hand up when she wasn’t coping and sought help,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed symptoms of depression could become worse during pregnancy.\n\nHe agreed doctors could increase an anti-depressant dose in order to control mood swings around menstruation.\n\nDr Schramm said he did not know when Ms Baden-Clay was last actively depressed.\n\n“The records show one of her most recent attendances on her GP at the Kenmore clinic, which was sometime in March, indicated she was complaining of mood swings,” he said.\n\nHe said he noticed a note in Ms Baden-Clay’s session with Carmel Ritchie in which she spoke of feeling “not good enough”.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne, Dr Schramm said it was not his belief the increase of sertraline dosage would be likely to have caused suicidal ideation.\n\n“You would normally expect that increased risk when someone first starts on that medication,” he said.\n\nHe added that depression was a factor for suicide.\n\nDr Schramm agreed he noted Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing possibly depressive cognitions at an appointment with counsellor Carmel Ritchie.\n\n“When people are depressed they look at life through grey-coloured glasses … they evaluate situations themselves in a more negative light through grey glasses. That often is associated with feelings of guilt and inadequacy and I appreciate it is simply cherry-picking one statement, but that struck me as something that may well have been said by someone who is depressed,” he said.\n\n“It may also represent the words of someone who may have as part of their personality, had some self-doubt.\n\n“I don’t think we should draw great certainty from one statement like that but that is certainly not inconsistent with someone who is depressed.”\n\nDr Schramm said Ms Baden-Clay’s visit to a doctor to treat mood swings around menstruation on March 19, 2012 were not “inconsistent” with depression.\n\n“It’s not inconsistent with it, that’s all I can say. It’s consistent with the GP assessing that she was depressed,” he said.\n\nDr Schramm agreed the notes of Ms Baden-Clay’s doctor in 2011, which revealed Ms Baden-Clay was experiencing guilt, low mood and tears.\n\n“They all signify a high chance that she was relapsing in her depressive illness,” he said.\n\nThe defence closed its case.\n\nJustice John Byrne told the jury all the evidence to be put before them in the trial had been presented.\n\nHe said lawyers’ addresses to the jury would begin on Monday, first with defence counsel Mr Byrne and followed by an address from prosecutor Mr Fuller.\n\nJustice Byrne said he would then sum up the case to the jury and they would retire to consider a verdict.\n\nThe trial was adjourned until 10am Monday.\n\n12.45pm: The 74th witness in the trial is forensic toxicologist Dr Michael Robertson.\n\nHe said he had been a forensic toxicologist for 20 years and had studied widely in his field.\n\nDr Robertson said he did a toxicological examination of the results obtained from Allison Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said the review was of Ms Baden-Clay’s post mortem results and the levels of a particular drug, called sertraline.\n\n“Sertaline is the active drug within the commercial or trade name medication Zoloft,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said it was an anti-depressant and elevated levels of serotonin in the brain, or mood-elevating chemicals, to reduce depression\n\nHe said sertraline was a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI), which increased levels of serotonin in the brain.\n\nHe said the drug would be broken down and metabolised into desmethyl sertraline.\n\nDr Robertson said the levels of sertraline in the blood of Ms Baden-CLay was .59mg/kg and levels of desmethyl sertraline were at 3.3mg/kg.\n\nHe said there was also some detected in the stomach and liver, at 5mg/kg and desmethly sertraline of 31mg/kg.\n\nDr Robertson said it was unusual for levels to be above 0.05mg/kg in a person.\n\nHe said average numbers he expected in a living person taking sertraline was 0.03mg/kg.\n\nHe said Ms Baden-Clay’s levels were elevated.\n\nDr Robertson said drug concentrations in the body usually altered after death, a phenomenon known as “post-mortem redistribution”.\n\nHe said studies showed sertraline redistribution usually did not change too much after death but tended towards being slightly higher.\n\nHe said elevated levels could be caused by the ingestion of a different amount of drug to the recommended therapeutic amount.\n\n“It might be there is an unusual amount of redistribution in this case, some level of contamination may have occurred during the post-mortem,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said there were a number of side-effects for sertraline, including common adverse effects such as anxiety, agitation, confusion, thermo-regulation or an elevation of temperature, and even serotonin syndrome or toxicity.\n\n“This is a well described adverse event that involves unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said serotonin effects varied from individual to individual.\n\nDr Robertson said serotonin syndrome occurred when levels were too high and started to affect other areas of the brain.\n\n“When you get too much of this drug you can get situations again where more profound confusion might exist in a general way, increased agitation, unusual behaviours,” he said.\n\nHe said studies showed individuals who were taking “SSRIs” were more likely to experience suicidal ideation.\n\n“The mechanism behind that is simply unclear … it usually happens when someone first starts to take medication or alters medication, those sort of things,” he said.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Dr Robertson agreed trace levels of serotonin in the stomach may have been transferred there after death.\n\nHe agreed Ms Baden-Clay would not be described as a “naïve” patient as she had been on Zoloft since 2003.\n\nDr Robertson agreed she would have likely developed a tolerance to the drug.\n\nHe agreed redistribution of drugs in the body meant levels in the extremities, such as a leg, would not increase as much as drug concentrations in the centre of the body.\n\n“The theory being if significant post-mortem redistribution takes place, the concentration in the central blood should have increased … more than it would in the peripheral blood,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson agreed drug concentration levels depended on time, the position of the body and leeching of fat from the body.\n\nHe said the liver would break down sertraline.\n\nHe agreed the fact the blood sample was from the liver was a factor in interpreting the concentration levels.\n\nDr Robertson agreed sertraline was usually reported as a multi-drug cause of death, rather than a drug alone.\n\nHe agreed the levels of serotonin in the blood were not consistent with an overdose causing death.\n\n“I would agree they are not necessarily consistent with those numbers,” he said.\n\nDr Robertson said he could not say the serotonin levels were inconsistent with causing death.\n\n“I can’t necessarily agree with that completely as I can’t explain the elevated drug concentrations completely, they might have been elevated for some reason … whether they indirectly had some involvement, I don’t know,” he said.\n\nIn re-examination by Mr Byrne, Dr Robertson said serotonin syndrome could occur in a regular user when the dose was increased.\n\n12.05pm: The 73rd witness in the trial is Ashton Ward who is the manager of a company called “Khemistry”.\n\nHe was called to give evidence by barrister Michael Byrne QC, for Gerard Baden-Clay.\n\nHe said he did time-lapse recordings of the tidal movements at the Kholo Creek Bridge between June 12, 2014 and June 22, 2014.\n\nMr Ward said the film was still images that were converted into a time-lapse video.\n\nHe said the camera was set to take a photo image every 2 minutes during daylight hours.\n\nHe said that was switched to once every three minutes on June 18, 2014.\n\nThe time-lapse videos were played to the jury, one a closer view than the other.\n\nIn cross-examination by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC, Mr Ward agreed the photos were initially taken every two minutes, so that one second equalled 50 minutes.\n\nHe said when it was changed to take one photo every three minutes, it became one second to every 75 minutes.\n\nMr Ward agreed he did not know what the area looked like in 2012.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay

Fuller QC he went to see doctors on the advice of his lawyers.\n\nHe agreed police took photos of him on April 21, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he could not remember telling police about the injuries on his torso.\n\nHe agreed people were concerned about the marks on his cheek.\n\n“When you say concerned, yeah, they kept saying that they had a concern so that concerned me so I told them what it was,” he said.\n\nHe said the injuries on his torso were “self-inflicted” and “just didn’t seem relevant”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he went to another doctor on the afternoon of April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he gave one of the doctors his business card and offered to give her assistance moving to the area.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused about the deed of variation he signed in order to obtain the rent roll in late 2011.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he would suffer a significant financial loss and return to owning just a quarter share in the rent roll business, if he defaulted on the variation.\n\nMr Fuller suggested the loss the accused would incur for defaulting on the rent roll variation was $46,800.\n\nHe asked Baden-Clay what loss he would incur if his wife left him.\n\nBaden-Clay said his wife was not paid a salary.\n\nHe agreed they had an investment property together, shares and an investment property.\n\nMr Fuller said couple had a net assets worth of $74,663.\n\n“You are asking an awful lot of hypothetical questions that I … I honestly can’t answer that,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed there would have been financial consequences for him if he separated from his wife.\n\n“If Allison and I had determined we were doing to separate, divorce or something like that, how that played out, I honestly don’t know,” he said.\n\n“I can’t now remember exactly why I told her that but it seemed to placate her at that time.”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he faced pressures on April 19, 2012 but they were “not significant”.\n\n“You put to me yesterday that Allison required certain things of me, including that I not go out at night, that I hand my phone to her, that I put that find friends application on my phone and I should clarify … I felt satisfied I had answered truthfully and factually answered all the questions you asked … it was actually my suggestion to load that application on our phones,” he said.\n\nThe accused said both he and his wife knew how to turn it off.\n\n“And on the one day I needed it, it failed me, that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller said the app didn’t stop the accused from meeting Toni McHugh or contacting her regularly.\n\n“That is correct. Predominantly instigated by Toni, but yes that’s correct,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller suggested Baden-Clay wanted to be with Ms McHugh.\n\n“Allison and I had recommenced our physical relationship that year and as I mentioned yesterday Allison and I had gone for around 9 years … yes, there were a number of women I went to for sex around that period … but Allison and I were rebuilding,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he was betraying his wife’s trust and continuing to do so on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I suggest to you Toni McHugh offered you a different life and you wanted to take that opportunity?,” Mr Fuller asked.\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, that’s not correct.”\n\nThe accused said he was “very ashamed” by his infidelity and wanted to put it behind him to move forward with his wife.\n\n“I did not feel that,” he said, of Ms McHugh and his wife meeting at the real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was “placating” Ms McHugh when he told her he loved her.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused if he would be exposed if his wife met Ms McHugh at the conference.\n\nHe argued she would find out about his affairs, the emails and the fact they had met for sex again since her discovery of the affair in September, 2011.\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed your wife, Mr Baden-Clay?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You killed her either in or at your house at Brookfield that night or in the early hours of the morning?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No.”\n\nMr Fuller: “You attacked her and the only way she could respond was to lash out and claw at your face and leave marks upon it?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller: “Probably as you smothered her and took her life from her?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “That is not true.”\n\nMr Fuller suggested his wife grabbed at his clothing, causing marks under his arm.\n\nMr Fuller: “You overpowered her pretty quickly, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “I never overpowered her at all … I never did anything to physically harm my wife in any way, ever, so your supposition and to take it further to suggest I did other things is absurd and I object to it. So I can’t answer your question.”\n\nHe said he did not know if his wife’s head came into contact with leaves in their backyard.\n\n“I did not have anything to do with anything that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked if he put his wife into the back of their Holden Captiva.\n\n“I had nothing to do with anything that you are asking me,” Baden-Clay said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not dump his wife’s body off Kholo Creek Bridge.\n\n“The suggestion that I would leave my children for any time in the middle of the night is absurd, let alone to do the dastardly things that you are suggesting,” he said.\n\nHe said he did not put his phone on charge at 1.48am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not shave over the scratch marks on his face.\n\n“I did not,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he let police to search his home.\n\n“I had nothing to hide,” he said.\n\n“I was a concerned husband and I’m a very concerned father, I remain so. It is not a facade.”\n\nThe accused agreed he took legal advice and did not give a formal statement to police.\n\n“My lawyer insisted upon it and so I followed that advice,” he said.\n\nHe said he never told his wife on the night she disappeared that she would run into Ms McHugh the next day.\n\nIn re-examination by barrister Michael Byrne QC, Baden-Clay reiterated he was never violent towards his wife on April 19, 2012.\n\n“I’ve never thrown a punch in my life in anger,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he and his wife had disagreed during their marriage but never by being disrespectful to one another.\n\nHe said he did not hear any noises that night.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not deceive his wife about anything other than his infidelity over the four years before her death.\n\nHe said he did not deceive his family and friends about anything else apart from his infidelity.\n\n“Deceive is a strong word but I protected Allison in relation to the extent of her depression, which we didn’t really know much about in the early years and Allison was very, very conscious that she really didn’t want anybody to know that she suffered from any mental illness so, certainly I protected Allison and didn’t tell any friends and family about her mental illness,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he deceived Ms McHugh by telling her there was a possibility they had a future together.\n\nHe said he was relieved when his wife discovered his affair with Ms McHugh but he did not tell her about other women he met for sex.\n\n“I had no intention of telling Allison about the other women.\n\n“I didn’t want to jeopardise any chance we had of making a future together, further, it was purely about the physical aspect that I went to those other women … over an extended period of time, admittedly,” he said.\n\nThe accused said there were occasions when he questioned whether it was beneficial for his wife to know intimate details of his affair with Ms McHugh.\n\nHe said counsellors told them it would be helpful for his wife to have her questions answered, but in his experience, it did not seem to be helpful to her.\n\nBaden-Clay said counsellor Carmel Ritchie put structure into those conversations and he felt more confident about having those discussions with his wife.\n\nHe said Ms McHugh did not stay at his house, but rather visited.\n\n“We’d had some physical intimacy at the house, I had told Allison about that, on one occasion she had a spare room at that point and there was a spare bed and we no longer had that … and a spare mattress,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he was concerned Ms McHugh was not coping very well and he wanted her to have the strength to get on with her life and find someone else.\n\n“In retrospect, looking at some of the things I said and did, it was pretty naïve and pretty stupid, but that was my intention,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he told Ms McHugh he did not want to be intimate with her until he was out of the marriage with his wife.\n\n“I felt stronger and more confident I would be able to maintain the distance if we weren’t seeing each other,” he said.\n\nHe said he hoped they would one day be friends.\n\n“I wanted to make sure we just had no physical relationship with each other at all,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed it was not a concern for him the two women in his life – mistress and wife - would meet at a real estate conference on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said it was not in his wife’s nature to be confrontational or to “cause a scene”.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought his wife would have anticipated Ms McHugh would have been there, anyway, adding that she had colleague Kate Rankin with her.\n\nHe agreed Ms McHugh had a volatile personality but in a public environment, was “always able to control herself”.\n\n“I really had no concern at all,” he said.\n\nThe jury was shown a page from his wife’s journal.\n\nIn it was written: “I don’t want to be alone. I am afraid of being alone and lonely maybe because I think I can’t handle it. I am afraid of failing – failing in my marriage and what people would think.”\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why his wife had written such a thing but believed it to be her handwriting.\n\nThe trial will resume at 11.50am.\n\n10.45am: The jury will today hear continued cross-examination of the accused by Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller QC.\n\nIt will be Gerard Baden-Clay’s fourth day in the witness box.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused whether he thought his wife may have had contact with his mistress Toni McHugh on April 19, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not think so.\n\nHe agreed his wife had his phone that night and Ms McHugh could have contacted him.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed his mistress knew where he lived.\n\nHe said he did not remember Ms McHugh telling him that not going to the conference on April 20, 2012 was not an option.\n\nBaden-Clay said he thought it was “probable” Ms McHugh would not call him after hours.\n\n“By the end of the conversation she had calmed down a fair bit,” he said of a heated discussion with Ms McHugh in the late afternoon of April 19, 2012.\n\nHe said he did not tell police about his dealings with Ms McHugh on that day.\n\nThe accused said he did not tell his family about the affair until he was told by a journalist it would be disclosed in a story.\n\nBaden-Clay said he told the police.\n\n“I didn’t anticipate the police were going to inform the media, but they did,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he spoke to police at the Brookfield Showgrounds on April 21, 2012.\n\nHe said he spoke to police on numerous occasions over those days and “answered every and any question they asked me”.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he did not make a formal statement.\n\n“That was the only thing that they asked me and I told them and had a lengthy conversation with (Sgt) Chris Canniffe … I pleaded with him and said I’ve been given legal advice and said what would you do in my position and it was Mr Canniffe who calmed the situation,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he wasn’t sure what CIB stood for or what a crime scene was.\n\n“I believe there were a couple of police I spoke to who were from the homicide,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he first met Sen-Sgt Narelle Curtis during a siege situation involving a cult at a property at Anstead.\n\n“I think Narelle may have been the officer in charge when that all occurred,” he said.\n\nHe agreed that was a positive dealing.\n\nBaden-Clay said he occasionally attended meetings with a Kenmore Police consulting committee.\n\nHe said police were “probably” in contact with him every day following his wife’s disappearance.\n\nThe accused said Sgt Canniffe was at first, very responsive, but as the days passed took longer to reply to phone calls.\n\n“I was very concerned about the whereabouts of my wife and often one communication and one text message a day was not enough for me, I desperately wanted to know what was going on,” he said.\n\nHe said he first spoke to his lawyer around midday on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said he met his lawyer at a Yatala service station complex midway between his office on the Gold Coast and Brookfield that night.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed the first call he made to his wife was at 6.32am.\n\nHe said he thought he sent her a text message before that but it was not recorded on the summary provided to the court.\n\n“I don’t know why,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he phoned his family at 6.44am.\n\n“My initial call was just to say have you heard from her or anything and in that conversation … they came over and helped,” he said.\n\nThe accused agreed he did not call his wife’s friends Kerry-Anne Walker or Wendy Mollah, in part because they lived too far away and he did not have Ms Mollah’s number at that time.\n\nHe said he did not get through to his parent’s house at Kenmore until 6.46am.\n\nBaden-Clay said he took the Holden Captiva to look for his wife because his Prado had been in a car crash on Monday April 16, 2012.\n\nHe agreed his car, the Prado, was parked closer to the driveway.\n\nHe further agreed the Captiva had been parked nose-in to the car port.\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he had driven the Prado all week despite the accidents, just not on April 20, 2012.\n\nHe said the car was not reversed into the car port when he got up that day.\n\nThe jury was shown a photo of Baden-Clay’s damaged Prado, which was side-swiped on the Monday before his wife went missing, parked in front of his wife’s car parked behind it in the car port.\n\n“There was nothing to stop me taking the Prado,” he said.\n\nThe accused said he first noticed the toys in the back of the Holden Captiva the morning his wife went missing.\n\nHe said it was not a “total surprise” to him they were in the car.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not put the toys in the back of the car.\n\nMr Fuller: “You didn’t move them there to make it look … normal, or a semblance of normal?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “No, I did not put them there.”\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents at 9.30am.\n\n“I thought that she’d gone for a walk I called them later on when the police were there,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he called them after he was “interrogated” by police for a couple of hours.\n\nMr Fuller: “But you called your friends first, didn’t you?”\n\nBaden-Clay agreed he called his closest friends before he called his wife’s closest friends, Ms Walker and Ms Mollah.\n\nHe said police did not prevent him from making calls on April 20, 2012.\n\nThe accused agreed police let him call his children’s school and take a call from the president of the P&C.\n\nHe agreed police were supportive of him with respect to his children and his dealings with the school.\n\nBaden-Clay said he was not concerned by the line of questioning from police, not like his father or his sister.\n\nHe said he called his wife’s parents as soon as he could.\n\n“I couldn’t see, my informing them was not necessarily for them to drop everything and come up, obviously that’s a natural reaction and that’s what they did,” he said.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not call Ms McHugh, either.\n\nHe agreed his wife was at least an hour overdue by 8am.\n\nThe accused agreed it was “completely out of character” for his wife to be late to meet a colleague, such as Kate Rankin, or an appointment.\n\n“I didn’t ring her parents until there was an opportunity to do so,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller asked the accused again why he rang his friends before he phoned his wife’s friends.\n\n“I called the Christs because we had plans for a sleepover that evening … I wanted them to be aware that Allison was missing and I wanted to ask if they had seen anything, I didn’t think that she would have walked to their house … we didn’t have any close friends … but I just didn’t think it was likely,” he said.\n\n“I anticipated she was coming home any minute but I was concerned about what was going to happen in the afternoon.\n\n“If Allison was in hospital and we found her, that would obviously throw all the plans…”\n\nHe said he called the Cheesmans because their home was going on sale that day and he was going to put some finishing touches on the property that day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he asked his father to go in his stead, but he was prevented from doing so by the police.\n\n“I was concerned about my wife but I obviously had my family and my business that was operating as well,” he said.\n\nHe agreed an employee took over the Cheesmans open house the next day.\n\nBaden-Clay said he did not know why he called his friend Peter Cranna that day, then added it was because he lived close by.\n\nHe agreed he and his wife had significant insurance policies.\n\nBaden-Clay said they had discussed reducing them because the premiums were high.\n\nHe agreed he contacted an insurance agency on May 1, 2012 about making a claim, at his father’s behest.\n\nThe accused said he was at his office when a media report came through on April 30, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said he went to Brisbane city and met his lawyer and barrister Peter Davis in his chambers.\n\nHe agreed police told him a body had been found.\n\n“They confirmed it was Allison,” he said.\n\nMr Fuller: “Are you confident of that?”\n\nBaden-Clay: “Yes, because we knew a body had been found and it was at that meeting they told us they were sure it was Allison. I remember being physically shocked by that.”\n\n10am: Gerard Baden-Clay will face more cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller today.\n\nThere is a short delay for legal discussion, the trial will begin when the jury enters the court.\n\nFollow the trial of the year day-by-day here:\n\nDAY 13: Allison’s journal ‘untrue’, says Baden-Clay \n\nDAY 12: Baden-Clay’s love triangle email trail \n\nDAY 11: Baden-Clay’s tears as he takes the stand \n\nDAY 10: How it unfolded as the Crown rests \n\nDAY 9: Plants on Allison found at her home \n\nDAY 8: Jurors inspect site where body found \n\nDAY 7: Neighbour’s explanation for scream \n\nDAY 6: Scratches not typical of razor \n\nDAY 5: Listen to triple-0 call to police \n\nDAY 4: Accused told lover to lie low \n\nDAY 3: Neighbours heard screams \n\nDAY 2: Daughter’s tape brings tears \n\nDAY 1: Photo shock in murder trial \n\nYesterday, the court heard that for four years Gerard Baden-Clay deceived everyone – his wife, his lover, his friends and family.\n\nHe lied to his wife when he told her his affair was over. He lied to his lover when he told her he would walk out on his marriage.\n\nHe deceived his friends and family when he told them he was happily married, that all was well in his relationship with his wife.\n\nUnder a fast-paced cross examination from prosecutor Todd Fuller, Gerard Baden-Clay admitted that for years he lived a double life, lying constantly to those closest to him.\n\nBaden-Clay told a Supreme Court jury he deceived his wife Allison about his affairs with three different women and continued to see his mistress Toni McHugh even after she found out about his infidelity.\n\nHe said he repeatedly told Ms McHugh he loved her to “placate her’’ and her volatile personality but didn’t tell Allison she and his mistress would be attending the same conference because there was “no risk’’ Ms McHugh would do anything rash.\n\n“There were a number of occasions when you had to say things to avoid the consequences of your actions during these couple of years, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller asked Baden-Clay during the accused murderer’s third day on the stand.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct.\n\nTweets by @TheMurrayD \n\n“You deceived your family and friends for that four year period as well, didn’t you?’’ Mr Fuller pressed.\n\n“Led them to believe you were happily married … that everything was good within your relationship with your wife.’’\n\nBaden-Clay agreed.\n\n“That you were a success, that your business was going well – and that was what was most important to you, wasn’t it? What people saw of you.’’\n\n“I wouldn’t say that,’’ Baden-Clay replied.\n\nBaden-Clay also told the court it meant nothing that he chose his wife’s birthday as the date he would walk out of his marriage in an email to his lover.\n\n“You went on to give her a date when you would be together, the 1st of July … which just happened to be your wife’s birthday,’’ Mr Fuller asked, referring to the email Baden-Clay sent Ms McHugh on April 3, 2012.\n\nBaden-Clay said that was correct, adding “which also happens to be today’’.\n\n“But you didn’t think about that when you sent that email, that was just coincidence, was it?’’ Mr Fuller said. Baden-Clay replied: “It was.’’\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay had sent that email as his wife worked to rebuild their damaged relationship, including finding them a marriage counsellor. “And behind her back, this is the message you are sending to Toni McHugh,’’ he said.\n\nBaden-Clay faltered when Mr Fuller asked him the first time he’d told his wife he didn’t love her.\n\n“The conversations that we had were, please forgive me, I’m just trying to recollect for you … I’m trying to see if I can think if I can give a reference in time,’’ Baden-Clay said.\n\n“I think it must have been in 2009, perhaps when we first went to see (psychologist Dr Tom George) and we had a few conversations around then.\n\n“We agreed to go together and it was after conversations with Dr George that we had further discussions with Allison that I (said I) still loved her but I didn’t feel ‘in love’ with her.’’\n\nHe was also pressed on a list of questions Allison had written in her journal to ask Gerard during one of their 15 minute “talks’’ recommended by marriage counsellor Carmel Ritchie in the days before she disappeared.\n\nMr Fuller said Baden-Clay lied when he claimed their talk had been on April 18, instead of April 19 as he’d initially indicated to police.\n\nBaden-Clay insisted Allison had asked him the questions from her journal on April 18. He said he didn’t know why she’d written “why so mean’’. “I don’t know and if she had been able to ask me that question she would have been able to expand upon that,” he said.\n\nThe trial continues today.\n\n","byline":"Brooke Baskin, Kate Kyriacou ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"couriermail.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T03:53:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T04:02:01.000Z","description":"IT is day 14 of the trial of former Brookfield real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, who stands accused of murdering his wife Allison Baden-Clay, 43, on April 19, 2012.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnhocwho-1226974836711?sv=3624e1012972819697c73b215ff1266a","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["perthnow.com.au"],"id":"ad120d9a60f90d3b9dd356fe69305c27","keywords":["accused murderer","marriage counsellor","double life","fast-paced cross examination","Murder accused","damaged relationship","volatile personality","life insurance","Digital manipulation","multiple affairs","four-year period","fast-paced prosecution cross-examination","Brisbane","Queensland","Australia","Supreme Court","Todd Fuller","Toni McHugh","Carmel Ritchie","Kate Kyriacou","Allison Baden-Clay"],"kicker":"’Elevated levels’","link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/day-14-gerard-badenclay-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-wife-allison-in-2012/story-fnhocwho-1226974836711?sv=3624e1012972819697c73b215ff1266a","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974836711","originalAssetId":"1226974352079","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"f5320252a2bbe17c3551c675e6a182cd","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"9jZDdrbjpJnFSrI0N-jePXucmY0Jn06x","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"2c3ec8e8443e2498892462cc80bbbe15","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"0wM2Zrbjr_2IG7bczHuuhP2XJ18zd2LR","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"f174c0b74973890268cb07f312992d3d","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974349919","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58d6ea842e84273d6251a12f62cf214a","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"BteG9qbjpjXJKSWDj3BAbjoY_c0foFfK","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"58c6342cb22789a6a4985b76c372a53e","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"F0aDBrbjpB3aP0WhQmgL_FovtRXrMFzB","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"ee6d7eaad7142f94c449f56eac2d8e61","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"ZmcmlrbjoAkw1AYzzBjIIkHPLI0SMD4g","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"EXPERT says Allison Baden-Clay had “elevated levels” of a drug, which has side effects including “unusual behaviours”.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Day 14: Gerard Baden-Clay on trial accused of murdering wife Allison in 2012","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Drug in Allison had ‘unusual’ effect","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"893f856a-0115-11e4-a199-d36e19f21cac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["baden=clay"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/perthnow/images/1226975161453?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975161453","originalSource":"CourierMail","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226975161427","subtitle":"893f856a-0115-11e4-a199-d36e19f21cac","title":"Drug in Allison had ‘unusual’ effect","width":100},"title":"Drug in Allison had ‘unusual’ effect"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"It’s time to get on the bandwagon.\n\nKyrgios will face Canada’s world No. 9 in the early hours of tomorrow, and the likes of tennis legend John McEnroe are predicting an upset, saying the 19-year-old can go all the way and win the prestigious Wimbledon crown as a teenager.\n\nHere are 10 things you didn’t know about Nick Kyrgios.\n\n1. HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME\n\nThe “G” is silent. So “Kirr-ee-oss”. Not “Kurr-gee-oss”, like the spelling would suggest.\n\n2. HIS BACKGROUND\n\nKyrgios is Aussie born. A Canberra boy. His father, George, was born in Greece and moved to Australia as a child. His mother, Norlaila, is Malaysian.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest of three kids. His brother is a lawyer and his sister an actor.\n\n3. HE WAS A CHUBBY KID\n\nKyrgios’ mother, Norlaila, admits her boy ate too much as a child. He loved his food.\n\nBut he eventually stretched out into a lean 1.93m (6ft 4in), 77kg frame and lost the puppy fat.\n\nMORE: The shot that stunned the world \n\nMORE: Legends, celebs in shock over Aussie Nick \n\nMORE: Why you don’t need to cheer for Tomic anymore \n\n4. THE HISTORY HE’S CREATED\n\nWith his 7-6 (7-5), 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory over Nadal — one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon history — Kyrgios became the first teenager to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Nadal did it himself against Roger Federer in the 2005 French Open. An ominous sign.\n\nThe youngest man in the men’s draw, the 144th-ranked Kyrgios also became the first player ranked outside the top 100 to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Andrei Olhovsky defeated Jim Courier at Wimbledon in 1992.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon since compatriot Bernard Tomic in 2011 and the first to reach the quarter-finals on debut since German Florian Mayer 10 years ago.\n\n5. BASKETBALL BECKONED\nCanberra is boasting right now about being the home of Australia’s hottest sporting stars. NBA star Patty Mills, the “next big thing” in basketball Dante Exum and Kyrgios are all products of the nation’s capital. Kyrgios was a hoops-mad kid as well, representing Australia in basketball as a young teen before making tennis his sole focus as a 14-year-old. He still loves the Boston Celtics.\n\n6. THE MONEY GAME\n\nSince turning pro in 2013, Kyrgios has played only 10 matches on ATP Tour. Of those, he has only won three and lost seven (going into Wimbledon).\n\nThis year, he’d won just one match on the pro tour — the Australian Open first round against Benjamin Becker, the namesake of the man Kyrgios has been compared to quite a bit today, Boris Becker.\n\nWhat it all means is he’d won $A248,000 in his career up until Wimbledon. He will walk away from the All England Club with a minimum $A409,806 for reaching the quarter-finals. The Wimbledon champion takes home $A3.19 million.\n\n7. HIS IDOLS\n\nIf Kyrgios can shock the world once more and defeat Raonic tonight, he is on track to meet the man he looked up to most as a child, Roger Federer, in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Another guy he really idolised as a youngster was Nadal.\n\nKyrgios first started playing tennis at six years old, in 2001. By that stage, Federer had already been a pro for three years.\n\n8. HE LIKES RAP\n\nKyrgios is a Lil Wayne fan. And he was into Wu Tang as a kid. He also likes R’n’B artist Rihanna.\n\n9. HE WAS A TOP JUNIOR\n\nWhile top juniors don’t always make it big, Kyrgios was a junior world No. 1 and won the junior Australian Open in 2013, defeating countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis in the final.\n\n10. HE LOVES A LAUGH\n\nProving he is not just a serious tennis robot, Kyrgios loves a comedy and is a big Family Guy fan.\n\n","byline":"CAMERON TOMARCHIO ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Tennis/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Latest News/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Media i/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports Tennis news/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/foxsports.com.au/tennis/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/news.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T05:15:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T05:15:56.000Z","description":"ADMIT it.

to staunch Kyrgios’s endless stream of bodyblows - the Australian sensation hit 37 aces and 68 winners - Nadal was typically gracious in defeat.\n\n“When you have an opponent that he decides to serve

fledgling career to shock world No 1 Rafael Nadal to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals.\n\nIn a performance that reverberated from the heart of the All England Club across the world, the 19-year-old from Canberra has pulled off one of the greatest upsets in tennis history.\n\n‘TWEENER’: THE SHOT THAT STUNNED THE WORLD \n\nBOOM BOOM TIME: MCENROE, CASH BACK KYRGIOS TO WIN IT ALL \n\nSISTER ACT: FAMILY SO PROUD OF NICK \n\nBOILOVER: RAFA PRAISES CONQUEROR KYRGIOS \n\nSCROLL DOWN TO RELIVE ALL THE ACTION FROM OUR LIVE BLOG\n\nHis 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 triumph over 14-time grand slam champion Nadal is the first time a teenager has beaten a world No 1 at the majors since 2005.\n\nIronically, the last player to manage the feat was Nadal, who beat Roger Federer at the French Open.\n\nWatched from the members’ pavilion by Australian greats Rod Laver and Neale Fraser, Kyrgios dissolved in emotion after putting dual Wimbledon champion Nadal to the sword on the most famous tennis court on the planet with a trademark forehand winner.\n\nHis father George and sister Halimah shed tears in the players’ box as the reality of triumph took hold.\n\nIcily composed, the Australian prodigy blasted his way to career-defining victory with 37 aces in a truly astounding serving performance.\n\nBy the end of the match, Nadal — grand slam tennis’s ultimate warrior — was broken and baffled on losing to world No 144 Kyrgios.\n\nNo male world No 1 had fallen to a player ranked outside the top 100 since Russian Andrei Olhovskiy, then ranked 193rd, stunned Jim Courier at Wimbledon 21 years ago.\n\nIf most of the 15,000 spectators around centre court were startled, Kyrgious was not surprised at all.\n\n“You’ve got to believe you can win the match and I did,” Kyrgios said.\n\n“You’ve got to believe that you can win and that’s the way I approached it.\n\n“I think I was in a bit of zone out there, I played some extradorindary tennis, I served at a really good level out there.”\n\nRevealing he had been irked by his mother Nill’s comment that Nadal would be too good, Kyrgios said: “I don’t know what she was thinking.”\n\n“The mind is buzzing, I’m just going to enjoy this, soak it up and not even think about my next match.”\n\nKyrgios will tonight face Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic for a spot in Friday’s semi-finals.\n\nFew would be prepared to write of the youngster who over the past week created a huge impression.\n\nFirst-round victory over Frenchman Stephane Robert was followed by a herculean effort to save a Wimbledon record nine match points against Richard Gasquet before he edged past Czech Jiri Vesely.\n\nThose excellent performances were eclipsed by 2hrs, 58mins of sheer excellence against Nadal.\n\nKyrgios’s only quandary post-match was how to celebrate.\n\nHe clasped his face in his hands, dropped his racquet and stared in disbelief at his support group, led by coaches Simon Rae, Aaron Kellett and Josh Eagle.\n\n“I didn’t know what to do, there are so many emotions,” he said.\n\n“I didn’t know whether to drop my racquet, to drop to my knees..\n\n“It is unbelievable.”\n\nContesting only his 14th match at senior level, Kyrgios blazed his way past a grand slam immortal — only two weeks after losing in the first round of a Nottingham Challenge.\n\nSince then, Kyrgios has won nine matches in a row — five at third-tier Challenger level and now four more at the grand temple of the sport — to stand on the brink of history.\n\nKyrgios would become the lowest-ranked player in Wimbledon history to win the tournament, surpassing world No 125 Goran Ivanisevic’s 2001 victory over Pat Rafter.\n\nThe teenager is guaranteed at least $432,000 and a rankings rise to world No 66 — only 18 months after he stood at No 828.\n\nA large reason for Kyrgios’s transformation the fringes to world-beater is his vastly improved fitness.\n\nAnother is his omnipotent serve, which has delivered a tournament-high of 113 aces and only 14 double faults against elite company.\n\nHis delivery was unworldly against shell-shocked Nadal, who only briefly latched onto it.\n\nKyrgios conceded only 12 points on his first set for the match. That statistic is simply breathtaking — especially against nine-time French Open champion Nadal.\n\nFaced with the most ferocious grand slam competitor in the world, Kyrgios did not lose a single first serve point, winning all 19 while gunning down 13 aces and thumping 22 clean winners.\n\nAnd he was able to maintain momentum despite Nadal using every piece of his devastating artillery.\n\nImpossibly laid back, Kyrgios seized the ascendancy by blasting drives past frustrated Nadal.\n\nUnfazed at letting slip a set point on Nadal’s serve in the 12th game, Kyrgios romped through the tiebreak after surging to a 4-0 lead.\n\nMaintaining incredible serving levels, the teenager produced the shot of the tournament midway through the second set, with a half-volley winner — played off a bare baseliner and between the legs.\n\nIn control, he will long rue a sloppy service game at 6-5.\n\nDespite holding game points, he dropped serve for the first time in the match — and the set.\n\nNadal’s relief was palpable as the Spanish bull jabbed his fist in delight. It had taken him 95 minutes to create the first crack in Kyrgios’s arsenal.\n\nNo player in international tennis saps energy from opponent like Nadal. Impressively, Kyrgios continued to trade heavyweight blows with the world champion.\n\nAnd when the tyro twice survived serving crisis deep in the third set before unleashing a monster forehand return Nadal could only push wide to lose the tiebreak, centre court erupted.\n\nKrygios’s father George and sister Halimah jumped to their feet in jubilation as he grabbed the third set with classic stand-and-deliver missile.\n\nMore assured with every exchange, Kyrgios pressured Nadal into unforced forehand error in the fourth game of the fourth set as the prospect of miracle victory became reality.\n\nServing for the match, Kyrgios didn’t blink, sealing the issue with an ace.\n\n","byline":"Leo Schlink in London

on Friday. A consequence of the move could be that their names are disclosed at some stage during the trial.\n\nLawyers for the AFL Players’ Association, which is representing the 34 players, have until 10.15am on Friday to decide whether to join voluntarily or face the prospect of being included at the orders of the court. The players’ legal team is headed by David Grace QC.\n\n“As Mr Grace QC made clear in court this morning, the players’ key concern is their anonymity,” AFLPA acting CEO Ian Prendergast said.\n\n“Despite speculation as to which players have received show-cause notices, the 34 players have not been named, and nor should they. The players do not believe that the action taken by the club and James Hird — the involvement in which they resisted — should change this.”\n\nJustice Middleton today ruled a tranche of secret ASADA documents about the joint investigation and its agreements with the AFL must be released to Essendon’s lawyers.\n\nThe swathe of documents would include ASADA’s interim report and any document between the AFL and ASADA related to the drafting and publication of the interim report. Hird’s legal team was given the green light to subpoena the AFL and its integrity chief Brett Clothier to supply them with some documents it received and sent to ASADA.\n\nBut the main argument was if the players themselves would be forced to join the proceedings and then publicly outed.\n\nDavid Grace QC acting for the players said they would suffer “irreparable reputational harm” if their identities were disclosed.\n\nHe said the players would not join the club and its coach James Hird in its action against ASADA joint investigation unless their anonymity could be guaranteed.\n\nMr Grace said he would seek suppression orders for the player if they were named as parties in the case.\n\nJustice Middleton did not rule out forcing the players to join the action as respondents and said while he understood the difficult position they were in, “hard decisions” would have to be made.\n\nJustice Middleton said the issue of joining players would be resolved on Friday.\n\nHe also flagged that Essendon and Hird’s lawyers should be provided with the documents ASADA chief Ben McDevitt used to make his decision to issue the show-cause notices.\n\nDaniel Star acting for ASADA revealed to the court there were 45,000 documents which could be relevant to the court action under discovery. He said the agency would provide a full defence to Essendon’s lawyers by July 9.\n\nThe direction hearing will continue on Friday.\n\nEarlier, lawyers for 34 former and current Bombers issued with doping show-cause notices met players yesterday to discuss the move.\n\n“We are working through a process with the players to determine whether they (the players) are willing to be joined as a party to the proceedings,” AFL Players’ Association acting chief Ian Prendergast told the Herald Sun last night.\n\n“It is still being considered by the legal team. While we weren’t interested in being joined to the action initially, we understand any decision made by the Federal Court will impact on the interests of players.”\n\nThe move came as suspended Bombers coach James Hird yesterday declared players and officials were robbed of the right to stay silent during interviews with AFL and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority investigators.\n\nIn documents lodged with the Federal Court, Hird claimed the Bombers should have been afforded “the common law right against self-incrimination”.\n\nInstead, Hird says, players and officials were “under threat of censure and sanction” from the AFL if they did not “answer every question asked”.\n\nNew details of the legal challenges mounted against ASADA by Essendon and Hird were revealed in documents lodged by both camps ahead of today’s Federal Court hearing.\n\nThe Bombers, Hird and ASADA will return to court at 10.15am to finalise which documents must be made available to parties and whether the players will join.\n\nFederal Court Justice John Middleton could also be asked to rule on an application by Hird for AFL integrity boss Brett Clothier to provide documents and give evidence in the witness box.\n\nA statement of claim lodged by Hird yesterday included the allegation that ASADA provided draft versions of its interim report to the AFL before it was completed.\n\nThe report was used by the AFL Commission as the basis for the heaviest penalties in football history slapped on the Bombers on August 27 last year.\n\n“On dates known to the respondent, ASADA provided drafts or versions of the Interim Report or parts thereof to the AFL,” the Hird statement alleges.\n\nHird’s statement claims that his legal team raised concerns about the validity of the AFL-ASADA investigation at the start of his interview at Etihad Stadium on April 16 last year.\n\nIt includes an exchange between Hird’s former legal counsel Tony Nolan SC and AFL investigator Abraham Haddad.\n\nNolan: “Now, gentlemen, we don’t want to enter into any debate as to the legal arguments today as to the nature of the joint investigation as distinct from two separate investigations. We’ll put that debate to the side for a later time, if necessary.”\n\nHaddad: “Okay. That’s good.”\n\nNolan: “We understand that’s what you say.”\n\nHird is studying in France and will return to Melbourne on July 28. His 12-month suspension from Essendon expires on August 25.\n\n","byline":"James Dowling, Grant Baker, Michael Warner

Organise a photograph with an AFL footballer and a woman in skimpy clothes and you have yourself a spot in the newspaper to promote your latest product/cause/event.\n\nIt could be anything from flavoured milk to ballet, but the formula has been used over and over again through the years.\n\nSo this week Retrogram has delved into the vault to find a few classic examples. If you can think of any we’ve missed, post a comment below or get in contact through Twitter at @_warwickgreen  and we’ll publish a selection next week.\n\n1. DERMIE AND MILK\n\nVictoria’s ailing dairy industry found a way to turn around its fortunes in the 1970s when it came up with the Big M concept. And a huge part of its marketing was “Big M Girls’’. How else was up-and-coming Hawks star Dermott Brereton going to manage to drink his carton of Big Chocolate back in 1983?\n\n2. LETHAL AND MORE MILK\n\nAnd without the help of Big M, Hawthorn skipper Leigh Matthews clearly would have struggled with this enormous football-shaped cake in 1982.\n\n3. KB AND TEA \n\nThe question is, did Kevin Bartlett take milk in his tea? Here he is pictured at Punt Rd Oval in 1980, getting a little help to promote Richmond’s sponsor, Tetley, and its upcoming Tetley Tea Party.\n\n4. KOUTA, ANGE AND TOY CARS\n\nCarlton pair Anthony Koutoufides and Ange Christou took time from pre-season training in 1999 to hop on to a Harley-Davidson with Hot Wheels representative Bianca Ross. Something to do with Hot Wheels sponsoring the V8 Supercar Showdown at the Australian Grand Prix apparently.\n\n5. RHYCE SHAW AND FAST CARS\n\nAnd while we’re on the Formula 1 and grid girls theme, then-Collingwood footballer Rhyce Shaw found himself at Fed Square in 2004. What else would you do but volunteer to have your head shaved by Fosters and Gillette GP reps Ana, Mieke and Katie and then hop into the cockpit of an FI car? Thumbs up, Rhyce.\n\n6. SAM AND LACE\n\nWhen Geelong ruckman Sam Newman wanted to display the Cats’ snappy lace-up guernsey in 1973, he enlisted the help of a model. Just so that we could compare it to the conventional woollen number, you understand.\n\n7. NICK RIEWOLDT AND BEER\n\nA decade ago the young Saints forward posed in this photo with VB Girls Julia Tink and Elisha Missen to help promote the Great Aussie Legends Evening at the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda. What that actually involved was beer tasting with more than 650 publicans. Tough gig.\n\n8. LLOYDY AND MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nAlso in 2004, Essendon’s Matthew Lloyd took time out from the forward line to join the chorus line. The photo at the top of this page was a cross promotion, with dancers from the musical comedy The Producers giving their show a kick along, while at the same time sporting the colours of the teams playing in that year’s finals series.\n\n9. KEKA AND BOOTS\n\nLong before he became a “lambassador’’, North Melbourne star Sam Kekovich was turning his attention to flogging products. Back in 1969 Keka enlisted the help of HSV7 ballet girls Joan Brockenshire and Heather Warnecke, presumably to promote the new range of locally made White Diamond football boots, famously worn by the likes of Peter Huddson, Ian Stewart and Ted Whitten.\n\n10. ST KILDA AND … NOT SURE REALLY\n\nNo. Not a clue, to be honest. The year was 1982 and for some reason St Kilda footballers Darryl Hewitt (26 career games) and Wayne Slattery (11) were out on the Moorabbin turf with a wheelbarrow, in which sat a bikini-clad, high-heeled model. Unless the Saints had just signed a sponsorship deal with a wheelbarrow manufacturer, it’s hard to know how this photograph ever came to be.\n\nRETROGRAM RECALL\n\nFROM Countryfootyscores on Twitter: How rural for the Retrogram country footy list? Leigh Matthews qualifies because Chelsea is in the Mornington Peninsula Football League.\n\nRETROGRAM SAYS: Fair suggestion, but I can’t have it. Chelsea is metro for mine. If you call it rural you have to say that St Kilda (which is further down the line at Seaford) is a country footy club.\n\nFROM Tigerbob on Twitter: What about Graham Arthur and Fred Swift from Sandhurst?\n\nRETROGRAM SAYS: Both outstanding players, who captained their clubs (Hawthorn and Richmond respectively) to premierships in the 1960s, but I couldn’t squeeze them in.\n\n","byline":"Warwick Green ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports AFL News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/foxsports.com.au/AFL/AFL Premiership/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/","/display/foxsports.com.au/AFL/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Media i/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Latest News/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl-new/","/section/foxsports.com.au/afl/","/section/foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T10:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T06:53:49.000Z","description":"IT WAS Elvis Presley who sang “Girls, in tight sweaters, girls, in short dresses, a walkin’ and wigglin’ by’’ in his 1962 song Girls!

HAWTHORN\n\n44pts 147.9%\n\nR16: North Melbourne (Etihad) W\n\nR17: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR18: Sydney (MCG) W\n\nR19: Western Bulldogs (Aurora) W\n\nR20: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR21: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR22: Geelong (MCG) W\n\nR23: Collingwood (MCG) W\n\nMatt says: This Hawthorn side just does not know how to lose despite everything that has been thrown at it. Remarkably remains in the box seat to claim top spot and now gets its coach and potentially one of its best players (Sam Mitchell) back. Still to play five of the teams currently in the top eight plus Adelaide away, but would only likely not start favourite in one of those games (Fremantle at Patersons).\n\n2. PORT ADELAIDE\n\n44pts 141.9%\n\nR16: Essendon (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR17: Richmond (Etihad) W\n\nR18: Melbourne (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR19: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR20: Sydney (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR21: Gold Coast (Metricon) W\n\nR22: Carlton (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR23: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nMatt says: Could have almost locked up the minor premiership with a win over Sydney three weeks ago, now a top two spot is looking anything but secure after losses to the Swans and Adelaide. Securing a home qualifying final has to be the goal. From there, can you imagine what a preliminary final at a packed Adelaide Oval would be like?\n\nRE-LIVE THE CHAT AND HAVE YOUR SAY BELOW\n\n3. SYDNEY\n\n44pts 137.9%\n\nR16: West Coast (Patersons) W\n\nR17: Carlton (SCG) W\n\nR18: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR19: Essendon (SCG) W\n\nR20: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR21: St Kilda (SCG) W\n\nR22: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR23: Richmond (ANZ) W\n\nMatt says: Premiership favourites with Hawthorn and deservedly so based on its last two and a half months. Still, Sydney is no certainty to finish top two given the draws of Hawthorn, Port Adelaide and Fremantle. Luckily for the Swans, they play the Hawks and Power on the run home so they can shape their own destiny. Unluckily though they have to play them both away. Could it be that we’re still talking about that costly Round 1 loss to GWS come the end of the season?\n\n4. FREMANTLE\n\n40pts 132%\n\nR16: Melbourne (TIO) W\n\nR17: GWS (Patersons) W\n\nR18: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Carlton (Patersons) W\n\nR20: Geelong (Simonds) L\n\nR21: Hawthorn (Patersons) W\n\nR22: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR23: Port Adelaide (Patersons) W\n\nMatt says: The derby win for an undermanned Fremantle was massive because it doesn’t play another side currently in the top eight until Round 20, by which stage it could have virtually locked up the double chance. Clashes with Geelong (away), Hawthorn and Port Adelaide (home) in the last month will determine the top two fate of last year’s runner-up.\n\n5. GEELONG\n\n40pts 106.8%\n\nR16: Western Bulldogs (Simonds) W\n\nR17: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR18: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR19: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR20: Fremantle (Simonds) W\n\nR21: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR23: Brisbane Lions (Simonds) W\n\nMatt says: Great draw to come, one that is rated as one of the easiest by Champion Data. But Geelong’s loss to Gold Coast a couple of weeks ago puts it well and truly on the back foot in terms of taking a spot in the top four. The Cats will have to win at least one, if not two, of their games against North Melbourne (Etihad), Fremantle (Simonds) an Hawthorn (MCG) to have any realistic hope of securing the double chance.\n\n6. COLLINGWOOD\n\n36pts 114.1%\n\nR16: Gold Coast (Metricon) L\n\nR17: Essendon (MCG) W\n\nR18: Adelaide (MCG) W\n\nR19: Port Adelaide (MCG) W\n\nR20: West Coast (Patersons) W\n\nR21: Brisbane Lions (MCG) W\n\nR22: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR23: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nMatt says: Popular consensus suggests Collingwood’s top four hopes were shot the minute it dropped the game it shouldn’t have against the Western Bulldogs. Given the draw ahead, the Magpies are probably just a rung below those sides anyway. May already be sizing up a week one elimination final at the MCG against any one of North Melbourne, Geelong or Gold Coast by virtue of finishing between fifth and seventh.\n\n7. NORTH MELBOURNE\n\n32pts 110%\n\nR16: Hawthorn (Etihad) L\n\nR17: St Kilda (Blundstone) W\n\nR18: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Geelong (Etihad) W\n\nR20: GWS (Startrack) W\n\nR21: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Adelaide (Blundstone) W\n\nR23: Melbourne (Etihad) W\n\nMatt says: North Melbourne has, according to Champion Data, the easiest run home of any team in the AFL. The question though is does that rating take in to account the inconsistencies of the Kangaroos? Hawthorn and Geelong stick out as the only two really difficult games left for Brad Scott’s men, who are still every chance of pushing further up the ladder despite the weekend’s shock loss to the Brisbane Lions.\n\n8. GOLD COAST\n\n32pts 101.2%\n\nR16: Collingwood (Metricon) W\n\nR17: Western Bulldogs (Cazaly’s) W\n\nR18: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR19: St Kilda (Metricon) W\n\nR20: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR21: Port Adelaide (Metricon) L\n\nR22: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR23: West Coast (Metricon) W\n\nMatt says: Gold Coast is surely now headed for its first finals series after a historic win against Geelong a fortnight ago. Given the expectations around the Suns now, they should be favourites in home games against Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast and away games against the Western Bulldogs (Cairns), Brisbane Lions (Gabba) and Carlton (Etihad). Wins in five of those games, maybe even four depending on percentage, should be enough to clinch a September berth.\n\n9. ADELAIDE\n\n28pts 105%\n\nR16: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR17: Hawthorn (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR18: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR19: West Coast (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR20: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR21: Richmond (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR22: North Melbourne (Blundstone) L\n\nR23: St Kilda (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nMatt says: A shock win in the Showdown on the weekend puts Adelaide back in the hunt to make the eight. The Crows have now won seven of their past 11 games and should make that eight from 12 against Greater Western Sydney this week, which could catapult it — for a week at least — in to eighth. But from there it gets hard. Hawthorn (home) and Collingwood (away) are challenging games while Gold Coast takes on the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions, while North Melbourne in Tassie also lies in waiting down the track. Can’t afford any slip-ups.\n\n10. ESSENDON\n\n28pts 104.9%\n\nR16: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR17: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR18: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Sydney (SCG) L\n\nR20: Richmond (MCG) W\n\nR21: West Coast (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Gold Coast (Etihad) W\n\nR23: Carlton (MCG) W\n\nMatt says: Unfortunately, like last year, the great unknown about Essendon is not so much its fixture but how it will fare in terms of the ongoing supplements saga. All things being even, and if the Bombers are performing to their optimum, then the draw presents the club with a chance to make the finals despite it being rated as the toughest run home of any side. But, like Adelaide, the Bombers can’t afford any more slip-ups ahead of the Round 22 clash with Gold Coast. An upset victory over either Port Adelaide (away) this week or Collingwood next week would be a big help.\n\n11. WEST COAST\n\n24pts 110.6%\n\nR16: Sydney (Patersons) L\n\nR17: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) L\n\nR18: Richmond (Patersons) W\n\nR19: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR20: Collingwood (Patersons) L\n\nR21: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Melbourne (Patersons) W\n\nR23: Gold Coast (Metricon) L\n\nMatt says: Couldn’t do what Adelaide did — win a game against the odds against its cross-town rivals. Big percentage remains a factor, but realistically now West Coast’s hopes of making the finals are gone. The Eagles have, after all, only won three games since winning their first three matches of the season.\n\n12. WESTERN BULLDOGS\n\n20pts 82.4%\n\nR16: Geelong (Simonds) L\n\nR17: Gold Coast (Cazaly’s) L\n\nR18: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR19: Hawthorn (Aurora) L\n\nR20: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR21: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Sydney (Etihad) L\n\nR23: GWS (Etihad) W\n\nMatt says: Great win against Melbourne on the weekend. Beyond that though, only the most ardent of Western Bulldogs fans would argue it should start favourite in any game other than those against St Kilda and perhaps Greater Western Sydney.\n\n13. RICHMOND\n\n16pts 96.5%\n\nR16: Brisbane Lions (MCG) W\n\nR17: Port Adelaide (Etihad) L\n\nR18: West Coast (Patersons) L\n\nR19: GWS (MCG) W\n\nR20: Essendon (MCG) L\n\nR21: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR22: St Kilda (MCG) W\n\nR23: Sydney (ANZ) L\n\nMatt says: Finally Richmond has a bit of breathing space between itself and the wooden spoon. The draw actually doesn’t look too bad for the Tigers. A few wins against the likes of Brisbane Lions (MCG), Greater Western Sydney (MCG) and St Kilda (MCG) again may paper over some of the cracks, but at least they will put smiles on the faces of a few fans ahead of a long, hot summer.\n\n14. CARLTON\n\n16pts 87.1%\n\nR16: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR17: Sydney (SCG) L\n\nR18: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR19: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR20: Gold Coast (Etihad) L\n\nR21: Geelong (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR23: Essendon (MCG) L\n\nMatt says: Shaping as being the season of ‘What ifs?’ for Carlton given close losses to Richmond (12 points), Greater Western Sydney (eight), Brisbane Lions (seven), Geelong (five), GWS (eight) and Collingwood (15). Finals chances were officially extinguished, if they weren’t already, with the loss to the Giants two weeks back.\n\n15. MELBOURNE\n\n16pts 78.1%\n\nR16: Fremantle (TIO) L\n\nR17: Geelong (MCG) L\n\nR18: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR19: Brisbane Lions (Etihad) W\n\nR20: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR21: GWS (MCG) L\n\nR22: West Coast (Patersons) L\n\nR23: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nMatt says: For the first time since 2007 Melbourne has beaten each of Essendon, Carlton and Richmond in a season. The form the Demons have displayed this year suggested they would take a top eight scalp at some stage, but perhaps the team is showing signs of tiring in the last couple of weeks.\n\n16. GREATER WESTERN SYDNEY\n\n16pts 77%\n\nR16: Adelaide (Spotless) L\n\nR17: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR18: Geelong (Spotless) L\n\nR19: Richmond (MCG) L\n\nR20: North Melbourne (Startrack) L\n\nR21: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR22: Collingwood (Spotless) L\n\nR23: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) L\n\nMatt says: You can’t sit here now and say with any confidence that Greater Western Sydney should start favourite in any of its remaining games. But you also know that the Giants will win again, at least once, somewhere, because their kids are just too good not to. Games against Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs in the last three rounds will be interesting tests.\n\n17.

The world’s tennis media thought likewise.\n\nHave to do it all again tomorrow and I can't wait! First @Wimbledon & I'm in the last 8 club!! #HaveThat\n\n— Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) July 1, 2014 \n\n“Kyrgios played probably the shot of the year, let alone the shot of Wimbledon, as he nonchalantly knocked a return drop-shot through his legs for the point,” wrote Mike Singer of CBS Sports.\n\n“It takes some kind of something to try that shot when you’re up a set, deadlocked in the second at three games each against the No. 1 player in the world.\n\n“Kyrgios maintained his moxie to pull the stunning upset. It’s the first time Nadal has lost to a teenager since 2007.”\n\nSlowly sinking in. What an unreal day! Thanks to Simon, AK, Anne-Marie & @JohnMorris1982 for all their hard work. Massive team effort. #BOOM\n\n— Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) July 1, 2014 \n\n'I like to give the people a bit of a show' #nickkyrgios\n\n— Paul McNamee (@PaulFMcNamee) July 1, 2014 \n\nSports Illustrated’s Courtney Nguyen concurred.\n\n“The 19-year-old Australian wildcard grabbed headlines last week when he saved nine match points to rally from two-sets to love down to beat No. 14 Richard Gasquet for his first top-15 victory,” Nguyen wrote. “Now, he’ll grab some more after hitting an audacious front-side tweener in the second set against Nadal.\n\n“The kid is a shot-maker.”\n\nChris Chase, writing for USA Today\n\n, joked Kyrgios’ was “clearly cowed by his surroundings” when playing the between-the-legs shot on the biggest stage, against the biggest opponent in the biggest match of his career.\n\n“Remember the name Nick Kyrgios,” Chase wrote. “The 19-year-old Australian has the necessary combination of skills, savvy, swag and serve to be a major player in the post-Federer/Nadal/Djokovic generation.\n\nAussie Aussie Aussie @NickKyrgios. Such composure and class!

He was clearly cowed by his surroundings.\n\n“Kyrgios won’t be 20 until next April. He was the youngest player in the men’s draw at Wimbledon and won three matches before taking the opening set against Nadal. Though he’s still a long way from contending at Slams, he’s a player to watch in the future, and not just when he goes through the legs.”\n\nJohn Branch, writing for the New York Times, was similarly I pressed with Kyrgios’ outing, noting he had become the “lowest-ranked player to beat Nadal since No. 690 Joachim Johansson beat him in Stockholm in 2006.”\n\n“Until the evening shadows fell on Centre Court Tuesday, the last time a teenager beat a No. 1 player at a Grand Slam event was at the 2005 French Open,” Branch wrote. “The winner was Rafael Nadal, over Roger Federer, a couple of days after Nadal’s 19th birthday.\n\nWildcard Nick Kyrgios just beat World No. 1 Nadal! Hats off. Well played champ.\n\n— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) July 1, 2014 \n\nKyrgios is the 1st teenager to beat a world #1 at a Grand Slam since Nadal def Federer at 2005 French Open. Congrats Nick. Stunning effort.\n\n— Darren Cahill (@darren_cahill) July 1, 2014 \n\n“Nick Kyrgios, a 19-year-old wildcard entrant from Australia, joined Nadal by beating him in the fourth round of Wimbledon.\n\n“All limbs and panache, Kyrgios battered Nadal with big serves, boundless reach and boyish enthusiasm. Ranked No. 144 in the world, but rising fast, Kyrgios looked immune to the pressure and fearless with his shots.”\n\nAussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi. @NickKyrgios the giant slayer! #wimbledon #believe pic.twitter.com/H8xt7lGRPh\n\n— Pat Cash (@TheRealPatCash) July 1, 2014 \n\nNick Kyrgios- the Wonder from \"Down Under\" shocks #1 Nadal at Wimbledon.

show for not being together.\n\n“There were other weaknesses in the competition.\n\n“Even though we came out of the show not together, we loved the experience.\n\n“I don’t look at it as a bad thing at all, it’s just the way the cookie crumbles.”\n\nThe pressure cooker environment of the show also caused conflict between the couples.\n\nIn a raging fight during tonight’s episode, Pusic and Stuart

Pusic said.\n\n“Then with two-and-a-half days to go, Russell and Carol said what we agreed to, we were not going to do that anymore. We felt like we were sabotaged.”\n\nPusic said at the time the tension was crazy.\n\n“Candy was very upset, she took off and I didn’t think she was going to come back,” he said.\n\n“She didn’t think it was fair.

It has drawn people who did not know the dead woman but were deeply affected by her plight.\n\nA cyclist on her way to work left a card that read: “We are so sorry for the sadness and loss that your family is experiencing. Our city grieves with you and for you. I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe woman, who also did not know the victim, said it was time Melbourne united and stood up to the violence plaguing the city.\n\n“I think the message that’s coming to us is we’re not safe on the way to work, on the way home from work, out cycling or going for a run,” she said.\n\n“It’s time as women, and men, we stand up and say no to this violence.”\n\nAnother woman touched by the death wiped away tears as she left a note addressed to the victim.\n\n“Dear unknown girl,” she wrote. “I’m sorry you had to lose your life in an unknown country at the hands of an evil mad man.\n\n“I hope you managed to have some fun in your young life and lots of love.\n\n“Although I didn’t know you, I will think of you everyday as I pass this spot.”\n\nMs Lau’s employer at a city chocolate shop said she had worked there since May 2012.\n\n“She worked in our kitchen as a valued member of our pastry team. She will be terribly missed here.\n\n“She was a wonderful person and a beautiful friend and colleague.\n\n“We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.\n\nHe added: “She was a beautiful, lovely person and will be sorely missed.”\n\nA friend who was laying flowers near the crime scene in Kings Domain told the Herald Sun: “I really liked her smile. She had a beautiful smile. I will never forget it.”\n\nThe friend, who did not want to be named, attended the same church as Ms Lau.\n\nMr Miller was nabbed at 3.30pm on Monday while he was sleeping on rocks in an idyllic coastal town more than 500km away from Melbourne.\n\nHe was spotted by off-duty police officers at Snug Cove, Eden, in southern NSW.\n\nDetective Inspector John Potter said the attack on Miss Lau was particularly violent.\n\nShe was assaulted sexual and physically, he said.\n\nInsp Potter said some of the woman’s family had been contacted in China and that they were to fly to Melbourne to formally identify her.\n\nInsp Potter urged women not to walk alone, especially in the dark, and to travel by public transport or taxi where possible.\n\n","byline":"PADRAIC MURPHY, REBEKAH CAVANAGH, JON

represented dog owners Shannon Holt and partner Evan Jeremiejczyk, said she had been shocked by the council’s stance.\n\n“I deal with councils all over Australia and none of them have been like Frankston,” she said.\n\nMs Greenaway accused the council of ignoring reports in favour of the dogs.\n\n“They (council) have been provided with an expert report that is very favourable on the dogs’ temperaments,” she said.\n\n“Their next-door neighbours have given favourable statements.”\n\nMs Greenaway said Ms Holt and Mr Jeremiejczyk’s lives had been destroyed by the ordeal involving the dogs.\n\nDEATH ROW DOG OWNERS QUIETLY CONFIDENT \n\nMs Holt said she is “numb” over the impending demise of her beloved dogs.\n\nMs Holt, who repeatedly broke down in tears during an interview with the Leader, said she had been financially and emotionally exhausted by the battle to save the dogs.\n\n“They are going to kill my dogs. There’s nothing I can do about it. I have lost everything,” a distraught Ms Holt said.\n\n“It’s hit us hard (financially). We are struggling. They (council) have too much power and too much money.”\n\nFrankston Council announced it would push ahead with plans to euthanase the dogs, Charlie and Sharni, owned by Ms Holt and Evan Jeremiejczyk, by the end of this week.\n\nIn a statement, the council said it would “humanely destroy the dogs” following a review and “based on the risk they pose to the safety of other animals and people”.\n\nMs Holt accused the council of being manipulative in its dealings regarding the dogs.\n\n“They were never going to give me my dogs back,” she said.\n\n“There’s nowhere to turn.”\n\nMs Holt said funds from an anonymous donor had already been soaked up in legal fees and neither she nor partner Evan Jeremiejczyk had the money for a Supreme Court challenge to the council’s decision.\n\nMayor Darrel Taylor said the decision to euthanase the dogs had been difficult for all involved.\n\nBut he added: “We have no tolerance for dogs not responsibly managed by their owners.”\n\nCouncil chief executive Dennis Hovenden said the decision was based on ensuring the safety of residents and their animals — a priority for the council.\n\n“The decision was based on the nature and impact of the attack on the cat last year, and on the risk of further attack on an animal or a person should the dogs be released.\n\n“The mayor and councillors are fully supportive of the decision, saying that they have little tolerance for dogs who are not responsibly managed by their owners.”\n\nOutraged supporters of Mr Jeremiejczyk and Ms Holt have voiced their anger on the council’s Facebook page.\n\nDebra Talbot wrote: “The people of Victoria request that you intervene and stop your employees from murdering two dogs that have been wrongly accused of killing a cat.\n\n“No witnesses ... you cannot kill on assumptions.”\n\nHAS THE COUNCIL MADE THE RIGHT DECISION? JOIN THE DEBATE BELOW\n\nJessie Cran added: “Why on earth is your council so hellbent on killing two dogs which pose no risk to the community ... what good is having a secure yard for your dogs if your dogs are dead?”\n\nCindy Battles posted photographs of the dogs, adding: “The whole family will never forget what you do ... these are not just dogs — don’t you get that? They are part of a family.”\n\nThe dogs were impounded after they escaped the couple’s Frankston property on November 8 and killed a cat.\n\nThey were due to be put down in March, but Mr Jeremiejczyk and Ms Holt won an 11th-hour reprieve when an anonymous donor provided financial support to help them launch a Supreme Court appeal.\n\nThe donor stepped in after Mr Jeremiejczyk and Ms Holt, along with supporters, chanted “save our dogs” during an impassioned demonstration outside Frankston Council offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court appeal was subsequently put on hold after the council agreed on a review.\n\nMs Holt has previously spoken of her devotion to Charlie, a male mastiff cross, and Sharni, a sharpei female cross, and what they mean to her family.\n\n“I can’t believe my dogs would viciously kill a cat. I know they would not,’’ she said.\n\n“I feel like I have lost my children … I am at the end of my tether.’’\n\nThe 24-year-old mother of two has set up a Facebook group “Please Save My Beloved Dogs’’ outlining her situation.\n\nMs Holt and Mr Jeremiejczyk pleaded guilty to a range of charges including having a dog at large and dog attack serious injury causing death at the magistrates court in February.\n\nMayor Darrel Taylor previously told the Leader that the decision to euthanase the dogs had not been taken lightly.\n\nMs Holt told the Leader earlier this year that she and Mr Jeremiejczyk had already spent $20,000 in pound and legal fees as they fought to save the dogs.\n\nMore to come\n\n","byline":"Christian Tatman ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/heraldsun.com.au/Leader sections/All local news and photos/Bayside news/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Leader sections/All local news and photos/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/leader/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/leader/bayside/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T05:42:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T05:42:49.000Z","description":"FRANKSTON Council has adopted a hard-hearted attitude over two dogs due to be euthanised by the end of this week, says lawyer Anne Greenaway.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/bayside/frankston-council-has-adopted-hardhearted-approach-after-declaration-to-put-down-two-dogs-accused-of-killing-a-cat-says-lawyer/story-fngnvli9-1226973890571?sv=da41c1f1673441adbd8e0e873ae0557e","name":"heraldsun.com.au"}],"domains":["heraldsun.com.au"],"id":"73d39f760b775053cfa2e0795d73160f","keywords":["injury causing death","sharpei female cross","financial support","impending demise","Outraged supporters","secure yard","Jessie Cran","Frankston","VIC","legal fees","Council chief executive","impassioned demonstration","male mastiff cross","magistrates court","Victoria","Australia","Supreme Court","Facebook","Inc.","Victoria Council","Debra Talbot","Darrel Taylor"],"kicker":"Battle over?","link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/bayside/frankston-council-has-adopted-hardhearted-approach-after-declaration-to-put-down-two-dogs-accused-of-killing-a-cat-says-lawyer/story-fngnvli9-1226973890571?sv=da41c1f1673441adbd8e0e873ae0557e","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973890571","originalAssetId":"1226973890571","originalSource":"Frankston Standard Leader","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/heraldsun.com.au/Leader sections/All local news and photos/Bayside news/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"db5e714d80b1e70e034169bf04a892fc","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973888319","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"UPDATE: Frankston Council has adopted a hard-hearted attitude over two dogs due to be euthanised by the end of this week, says a lawyer.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Frankston Council has adopted ‘hard-hearted’ approach after declaration to put down two dogs accused of killing a cat, says lawyer","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Tanya Fry"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Council taken hard attitude: lawyer","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"631a3560-00d9-11e4-b444-f0362e94d0af - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["dogs","photo","Shannon Holt"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/heraldsun/images/1226975317951?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226975317951","originalSource":"News Corp Australia","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226975317925","subtitle":"631a3560-00d9-11e4-b444-f0362e94d0af","title":"VIC_FRANKSTON_DOG FIGHT_WK38","width":100},"title":"Council taken hard attitude: lawyer"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":[],"body":"The photo — which shows the first time Bethany Townsend, 23, dared to bare after being fitted with two colostomy bags — has now been viewed by an incredible nine million people.\n\nBethany, a makeup artist from Worcester in the UK, has been so overwhelmed by the response that she can finally acknowledge that the colostomy bags doesn’t define who she is.\n\n“I didn’t expect this kind of reaction at all,” she said of the picture.\n\n“When I first had the bags fitted I was devastated — the reaction to this photo has really helped me accept them.\n\n“The photo has been seen by millions of people ... I’m just so glad that it’s brought about more awareness of Crohn’s disease, and it’s made me feel so much more confident.”\n\nBethany was fitted with her colostomy bags after battling with Crohn’s disease since the age of three. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, affecting the sufferer’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste.\n\nIn extreme situations like Bethany’s, it becomes necessary to remove the damaged section of the intestine and bring the healthy part out as a stoma — known as a colostomy.\n\nAfter almost dying when her bowel ruptured in 2010, Bethany woke from a life-saving operation to find she had been fitted with two colostomy bags.\n\n“Growing up I’d had various surgeries to try and combat the Crohn’s,” said Townsend. “I’d go in and have sections of my intestine cut out, but I’d only be in remission for a couple of weeks before it came back again.\n\n“Then, four years ago I woke up in the morning and couldn’t move because I was in so much agony. I had to break a glass on the floor to alert my mum who called on ambulance. When the paramedics came they lifted up my top to see that my surgery scar had split open. I was rushed to intensive care where they doctors told me family I would need more surgery as my intestines had become infected and inflamed again. I had no idea when I woke up that I would have the bags.\n\n“When I first woke up and my mum told me about them I was just relieved as I’d thought I was going to die. When I came out of hospital and everything finally sunk in, I remember going upstairs into my bedroom and just bursting into tears.\n\n“I’d known a colostomy bag might have been an option but it was always something that I had wanted to avoid. I had a really good cry that day, and since then I haven’t shed another tear — I’ve just got on with it I suppose.”\n\nIt was only after Townsend met and married her husband, Ian, 33, and jetted off to Mexico last Christmas that she finally felt ready to embrace the colostomy bags.\n\n“When I met Ian I showed him my bags straight away, but he didn’t bat an eye lid — I actually felt like I was overreacting,” she said.\n\n“He taught me that there was more to me than the bags and would always encourage me to show off my figure. I wasn’t sure but in Mexico I finally realised he was right, and decided to wear my bikini.\n\n“At first I was nervous and worried that people would stare but it was fine. The staff at the hotel asked me about the bags on the last day of the holiday, but rather than being offended I was glad because it meant I could talk to them about Crohn’s and tell them what it is.\n\n“I decided to get in touch with Crohn’s and Colitis UK Facebook group to see if they would let me post something on their page. I sent them the picture and my information, and it all blew up from there.”\n\nTownsend still suffers from Crohn’s disease and hopes ones day for a cure, but for now she is considering getting back into modelling — a career she gave up on after she was fitted with the bags.\n\n“I feel confident enough now to put myself out there and pursue modelling again,” she said.\n\n“I did a little bit of work here and there before I had the colostomy bags, but once I had them fitted I thought that was the end of the dream. I’m looking forward to chasing my goals, and I know now that nothing can hold me back.\n\n“I won’t let the Crohn’s control me anymore.”\n\n","byline":"Caters News ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/geelongadvertiser.com.au/Network News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Lifestyle - syndicated/Beauty/NN-NC-SEC-LIFESTYLE-BEAUTY-FACE &amp;

HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME\n\nThe “G” is silent. So “Kirr-ee-oss”. Not “Kurr-gee-oss”, like the spelling would suggest.\n\n2. HIS BACKGROUND\n\nKyrgios is Aussie born. A Canberra boy. His father, George, was born in Greece and moved to Australia as a child. His mother, Norlaila, is Malaysian.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest of three kids. His brother is a lawyer and his sister an actor.\n\n3. HE WAS A CHUBBY KID\n\nKyrgios’ mother, Norlaila, admits her boy ate too much as a child. He loved his food.\n\nBut he eventually stretched out into a lean 1.93m (6ft 4in), 77kg frame and lost the puppy fat.\n\nMORE: The shot that stunned the world \n\nMORE: Legends, celebs in shock over Aussie Nick \n\nMORE: Why you don’t need to cheer for Tomic anymore \n\n4. THE HISTORY HE’S CREATED\n\nWith his 7-6 (7-5), 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 victory over Nadal — one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon history — Kyrgios became the first teenager to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Nadal did it himself against Roger Federer in the 2005 French Open. An ominous sign.\n\nThe youngest man in the men’s draw, the 144th-ranked Kyrgios also became the first player ranked outside the top 100 to defeat a world No. 1 at a grand slam since Andrei Olhovsky defeated Jim Courier at Wimbledon in 1992.\n\nKyrgios is the youngest man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon since compatriot Bernard Tomic in 2011 and the first to reach the quarter-finals on debut since German Florian Mayer 10 years ago.\n\n5. BASKETBALL BECKONED\nCanberra is boasting right now about being the home of Australia’s hottest sporting stars. NBA star Patty Mills, the “next big thing” in basketball Dante Exum and Kyrgios are all products of the nation’s capital. Kyrgios was a hoops-mad kid as well, representing Australia in basketball as a young teen before making tennis his sole focus as a 14-year-old. He still loves the Boston Celtics.\n\n6. THE MONEY GAME\n\nSince turning pro in 2013, Kyrgios has played only 10 matches on ATP Tour. Of those, he has only won three and lost seven (going into Wimbledon).\n\nThis year, he’d won just one match on the pro tour — the Australian Open first round against Benjamin Becker, the namesake of the man Kyrgios has been compared to quite a bit today, Boris Becker.\n\nWhat it all means is he’d won $A248,000 in his career up until Wimbledon. He will walk away from the All England Club with a minimum $A409,806 for reaching the quarter-finals. The Wimbledon champion takes home $A3.19 million.\n\n7. HIS IDOLS\n\nIf Kyrgios can shock the world once more and defeat Raonic tonight, he is on track to meet the man he looked up to most as a child, Roger Federer, in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Another guy he really idolised as a youngster was Nadal.\n\nKyrgios first started playing tennis at six years old, in 2001. By that stage, Federer had already been a pro for three years.\n\n8. HE LIKES RAP\n\nKyrgios is a Lil Wayne fan. And he was into Wu Tang as a kid. He also likes R’n’B artist Rihanna.\n\n9. HE WAS A TOP JUNIOR\n\nWhile top juniors don’t always make it big, Kyrgios was a junior world No. 1 and won the junior Australian Open in 2013, defeating countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis in the final.\n\n10. HE LOVES A LAUGH\n\nProving he is not just a serious tennis robot, Kyrgios loves a comedy and is a big Family Guy fan.\n\n","byline":"CAMERON TOMARCHIO ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Tennis/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Latest News/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Media i/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports Tennis news/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/Tennis news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/foxsports.com.au/tennis/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/news.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tennis/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/tennis/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"news.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-02T05:15:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-02T05:15:56.000Z","description":"ADMIT it.

Every time you go on the RSVP website all they talk about is star signs and footy,” Ms Baltatzidis told the Herald Sun.\n\nMs Baltatzidis claimed a consultant insisted on introducing her to a primary school teacher despite her objection that he wasn’t suitable for her.\n\n“When I called him he was unappealing and completely negative about his experience with Blue Label Life,” she claimed.\n\n“He had no personality, no humour, no spark. He was a bit of a boring sod.”\n\nShe claimed she never heard from a second candidate and a phone introduction to another man proved unsuitable as he lived in Jan Juc and was a “weirdo”.\n\nThe consultant described the men as “wonderful, successful” and “genuine gentlemen” who were excited to meet Ms Baltatzidis.\n\nMs Baltatzidis said Blue Label Life sent her two more profiles of men it said were “extremely compatible” with her in July 2011 despite her demands for a refund, which the agency refused.\n\nBlue Label Life claims all matches are “scientifically compatible” and hand-picked from an “extensive and elite pool of members”.\n\nDirector Samantha Jayne said she wasn’t notified of the VCAT hearing and a review of the order has since been recommended.\n\nMs Jayne said Ms Baltatzidis was given numerous opportunities to meet with suitable candidates.\n\n“Between July 2011 and December 2011 I personally tried to engage with Ms Baltatzidis and to work out a way forward or a resolution to her issue, but Ms Baltatzidis’ behaviour and what we felt at the time were unreasonable demands made it impossible for a resolution to be found,” she told the Herald Sun.\n\nangus.thompson@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"ANGUS THOMPSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and

The tape is applied to an injured muscle or tendon and as the muscle or joint lengthens, the tape is stretched to absorb load and reduce the work on the muscles. This results in decreased workload, demand on the muscle and improved tolerance to fatigue.\n\nManaging Director of Dynamic Tape, Ryan Kendrick, told news.com.au he had no idea Kyrgios was using his Tribal Tape, but wasn’t surprised that people mistook the product for a real tattoo.\n\n“When I have worn it myself people often ask to see my tattoo and I have had many of my patients recount funny stories like an 85-year-old great grandmother whose son was disgusted with her as he thought she had gone out and got some ink!” he said.\n\nHe said Ana Ivanovic and Sania Mirzer used the tan tattoo version of the product at the Australian Open earlier this year while Tommy Haas wore the black tattoo design. Serena Williams, Laura Robson and Kim Clijsters have also used the product.\n\nKendrick said the tattoo design came about because he was living on Norfolk Island when the tape was developed and wanted to reflect the heritage of the island and the South Pacific.\n\n“The design was given to us by a very well known Polynesian artist and tattooist named Tihoti. Tihoti is Tahitian but his wife is a Norfolk Islander. Norfolk relies heavily on tourism and with the global financial crisis and high Australian Dollar, they were suffering so it was our way of spreading the word about Norfolk Island a little.”\n\nKinesio Australia Education Director, Clint Bridges, says while the tribal tape is not an official Kinesio product, the Kinesio taping method is regularly used on the tennis circuit.\n\n“Novak Djokovic, Li Na and Serena Williams all use a beige form of the tape on court. At a base level, it’s used to try and change the way the muscle is firing. There are specific tensions for different tasks which changes the way the brain thinks that muscle is working.\n\n“Certain tensions provide stimulus on the skin, which sends a message to the brain. The brain then reinterprets that message and sends instructions back to the muscle so it learns how to behave. There would be one tension for relaxation of the muscle if it’s tight and one for activation.”\n\nKendrick said the tape was released commercially in Australia in late 2010, followed by the UK and then North America in 2012. The tape was used by a number of athletes at the London 2012 games and is now available in 25 countries.\n\nSo there you have it, for all those out there wanting the Kyrgios tattoo, you’re in luck.\n\nFor just $15.10, you can buy five metres of the stuff.\n\nWere you fooled by Kyrgios’ tattoo?

Although it is believed she had no family in Melbourne, Ms Lau, a Chinese national, had made industry friends here, particularly at the William Angliss Institute.\n\nBut those who placed cards and flowers at the site of her death were mainly from her church, who remembered Ms Lau for her faith and her smile.\n\nFellow colleagues of Renea Lau said she was a “beautiful, lovely person” who will be sorely missed.\n\n“It is with deep sadness that we can confirm Renea Lau was an employee here,” Steven Kearney, her employer, said.\n\n“She’s been with us since May 2012. She worked in our kitchen as a valued member of our pastry team. She will be terribly missed here.\n\n“She was a wonderful person and a beautiful friend and colleague.\n\n“We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.\n\nHe added: “She was a beautiful, lovely person and will be sorely missed. It is a difficult time for us and we do not wish to comment further.”\n\nIn contrast, the riches to rags story of Mr Miller had led him to Melbourne’s Janet Lady Clarke rotunda, opposite the tan track.\n\nHe had fallen on hard times since running a nightclub in the 1990s and reportedly until a couple of months ago was living in a shed on a property in Darwin and making didgeridoos.\n\nIt will be alleged their paths met for the first and only time as they walked along the tree-lined St Kilda Rd - one of Melbourne’s busiest streets.\n\nThe cameras capture Ms Lau running towards Kings Domain. Hours later a jogger would find her battered body near the Victoria Police Memorial.\n\nHomicide investigators had the awful task of informing Ms Lau’s siblings of her death, who in turn told her parents.\n\nHer alleged attacker was apprehended after a three-day manhunt sleeping on rocks in the southern NSW coastal town of Eden.\n\nMr Miller’s extradition to Victoria was granted by a Batemans Bay magistrate and he was flown to Melbourne for questioning at the St Kilda Road Police Complex today.\n\nMr Miller will appear in court tomorrow after he is remanded at the Melbourne Custody Centre.\n\nFriends and complete strangers returned to the scene of Ms Lau’s murder today.\n\nDespite not knowing the dead woman, a local resident who wished only to be known as Rod was so touched by her death that he laid a bunch of yellow flowers just metres from where her body was found before holding a minute’s silence.\n\n“It’s terrible. I really feel sorry for her parents,” he said.\n\n“It shouldn’t have happened here. It’s a beautiful spot.”\n\nA cyclist on her way to work left a card that read: “We are so sorry for the sadness and loss that your family is experiencing.\n\n“Our city grieves with you and for you. I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe woman, who also did not know the victim, said it was time Melbourne united and stood up to the violence plaguing the city.\n\n“I think the message that’s coming to us is we’re not safe on the way to work, on the way home from work, out cycling or going for a run,” she said.\n\n“It’s time as women, and men, we stand up and say no to this violence.”\n\nAnother woman touched by the death wiped away tears as she left a note addressed to the victim.\n\n“Dear unknown girl,” she wrote. “I’m sorry you had to lose your life in an unknown country at the hands of an evil mad man.\n\n“When WILL men stop killing women? Why was he not in an institution?\n\n“I hope you managed to have some fun in your young life and lots of love.\n\n“Although I didn’t know you, I will think of you everyday as I pass this spot.”\n\n","byline":"Jon Kaila, Christopher Gillett, Rebekah Cavanagh ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp; Order/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/HS Top News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp; Order/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/victoria/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T07:49:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T07:49:45.000Z","description":"THE first picture has emerged of Kings Domain murder victim Renea Lau.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnii5smt-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnii5smp-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnii5sms-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fni0fee2-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnitcyla-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnii5smr-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","name":"perthnow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","perthnow.com.au"],"id":"af621d0446fd98fbcdc10c6bbc1905aa","keywords":["faces extradition","Chinese national","hospitality worker","Homicide detectives","walking south","violent assault","food shelters","Salvation Army","Carlton Hotel","Scott Allen Miller","John Potter","Jon Kaila","Stewart","Mark","homeless man","talented didgeridoo maker","idyllic coastal town","off-duty police officers","random attack","public transport","Horrifying footage","nightclub business","Garden killing manhunt","New South Wales","Australia","China","Melbourne","Victoria","Perth","Western Australia","Darwin","Northern Territory","St Kilda","Crime Department","Rebekah Cavanagh"],"kicker":"‘Beautiful, lovely person’","link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/first-picture-of-kings-domain-murder-victim-renea-lau-emerges/story-fnitcyla-1226972974779?sv=22b765a461af059cdbb25e08f05052f6","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226972974779","originalAssetId":"1226972974779","originalSource":"HeraldSun","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"c5ee86aad7b1811a6ab6318836d9430f","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"tzam5pbjo6PWltCXa5hTzfa9tABsdeaW","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":" THE first picture has emerged of Kings Domain murder victim Renea Lau, as a homeless man accused of her death will be extradited to Victoria.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"First picture of Kings Domain murder victim Renea Lau emerges ","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"First image of murder victim emerges","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"1b96dd1a-00f2-11e4-8611-f1c2246e8a9e -

and their ages would be hard to prove.\n\nMs Wass urged the Judge to let the jury decide if the underdeveloped bodies meant they were young.\n\nHarris was not required to enter a plea on four charges relating to downloading indecent images of children, and the charges were not dealt with as part of his trial on 12 charges of indecently assaulting girls and a young woman between 1968 and 1986.\n\nDuring the pre-trial hearing, Judge Nigel Sweeney also ruled that most of the prosecution’s “bad character” witnesses – other people who made allegations of lecherous behaviour - were admissible.\n\nThe hearing was delayed at one point when a member of the public tweeted three pages of evidence not meant for publication.\n\nAfter being informed of the breach, Judge Sweeney called a halt to proceedings and asked the offender to own up – but nobody did.\n\nThe suspect tweeter was reported to have been a member of a child abuse activist group.\n\nThe trial hit other delays, including one caused by a missing box of evidence.\n\nWhen contradictory old film footage surfaced that placed him in Cambridge — an area where he said he’d never been at the time – Harris’ lawyers tried to have it kept from the jury.\n\nIt was Thames Television footage of a 1978 celebrity sport game show starring Harris – and one of Harris’s accusers alleged she was waitress at the event, when she was 13 or 14.\n\nA person following the case in the local media tipped the prosecution off about the footage, and in the jury’s absence the prosecutor urged the judge to admit the tape as evidence.\n\nHarris’s lawyers unsuccessfully objected to the new evidence, claiming it would unfairly prejudice his case and he had a “less than perfect” memory, despite having been adamant in his evidence that he had not been there.\n\n","byline":"Staff writers ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp; Order/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp; Order/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T03:11:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T03:12:19.000Z","description":"EXPLOSIVE evidence kept secret from the Rolf Harris jury can now be fully reported for the first time.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/jury-never-told-of-claims-that-rolf-harris-downloaded-child-porn-cruised-youngest-teen-porn-and-tried-to-erase-browsing-history/story-fni0fee2-1226973232203?sv=2eb4742192b1deefd6e6617807ccc475","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/jury-never-told-of-claims-that-rolf-harris-downloaded-child-porn-cruised-youngest-teen-porn-and-tried-to-erase-browsing-history/story-fnitcyla-1226973232203?sv=2eb4742192b1deefd6e6617807ccc475","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"0012186c436a1b663a50ada5f00eec88","keywords":["child abuse","teen porn sites","browsing history","browser history","Staff writers","internet blackout","child safety video","young women","young girls","pre-trial arguments","London","United Kingdom","Thames Television Ltd.","Rolf Harris","Sasha Wass","Judge Nigel Sweeney","child sex trial","child abuse video","child porn","pre-trial hearing","Australian entertainment circles","SHOCKING child images","suspect images","teddy bear","game show","film footage","eastern European country","abuse activist group"],"kicker":"Harris trial","link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/jury-never-told-of-claims-that-rolf-harris-downloaded-child-porn-cruised-youngest-teen-porn-and-tried-to-erase-browsing-history/story-fnitcyla-1226973232203?sv=2eb4742192b1deefd6e6617807ccc475","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973232203","originalAssetId":"1226973232203","originalSource":"HeraldSun","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp; Order/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"VIDEO","id":"876935a6252413c2792d5ba9c4b0f5f5","origin":"VIDEO_INTEGRATOR","originId":"JwNTNkbjqYGUrwGk8sEFK1eM90TvZd5y","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":" SHOCKING child images, cruising teen porn sites, other alleged victims – this is what the Rolf Harris jury didn’t get to hear.

Does he know information that we don’t?\n\n“That needs to happen somewhat urgently I would have thought.”\n\nAsked if Harcourt’s position was untenable, Little said: “I think if he acted above and beyond the brief that he had to speak at this international conference then he requires to be sanctioned. What that sanction is I’m not going to speculate about that.\n\n“If he was exceeding his authority we have a problem with him. If he was doing what the AFL had signed off on, then we have a problem with the AFL.\n\n“So we are not quite sure where that sits.”\n\nEARLIER today, the AFL Players’ Association has condemned comments from the league’s chief medical officer suggesting “broad acceptance” by Essendon players of the club’s supplements program.\n\nThe AFL has sensationally revealed it sent specimens from Essendon players to Germany during 2012 — months before the club “self-reported” to the league and ASADA.\n\nA video emerged yesterday where AFL chief medical officer Dr Harcourt stated that the AFL had caught “wind” that the Bombers were using exotic drugs.\n\nIn the video Dr Harcourt says “most athletes of the team were involved — so there was quite broad acceptance by the players of this program even though it involved quite unusual practices and hundreds of injections.”\n\nROBBO: AFL’S ACTIONS HARD TO FATHOM \n\nESSENDON PLAYER IDENTITIES MAY BE REVEALED \n\nHowever the AFLPA hit back on Thursday morning, with acting CEO Ian Prendergast saying players didn’t expect to be subjected to such experimental substances. The players union says it will seek further information from the AFL regarding Dr Harcourt’s comments.\n\n“We disagree with Dr Harcourt’s suggestion that players passively accepted the use of supplements and did not ‘jack up and say what the hell is going on’,” Prendergast said.\n\n“As has been made abundantly clear on many occasions, players took an active role in ensuring that the substances they were to be administered were compliant with the WADA Code and were provided with written guarantees from the club to that effect. This is hardly what we would call ‘passive acceptance’.”\n\nHarcourt’s explosive claims were made in an address to an anti-doping conference in Zurich last November and seized on by lawyers for suspended Essendon coach James Hird in the Federal Court today.\n\nThe revelations raise fresh questions about what was known and suspected within the AFL about Essendon’s 2012 drugs regime.\n\n“We did have some wind of this during the course of the year — it was 2012,” Harcourt said in his address.\n\n“And so we did arrange through ASADA to have a number of specimens of these players sent to the Cologne laboratory rather than the Sydney laboratory — but nothing came out of it.\n\n“Most athletes of the team were involved — so there was quite broad acceptance by the players of this program even though it involved quite unusual practices and hundreds of injections.\n\n“It was shocking the extent to which experimental drugs were given to young athletes.\n\n“It highlighted the craziness or madness of certain individuals in the support staff who really didn’t come to grips with what they were doing.”\n\nHarcourt also made the stunning claim in the video that “35-odd” Essendon players were being monitored for “potential hormonal issues or cancers”.\n\nPrendergast was also critical of the AFL chief medical officer to speak publicly about any potential health issues.\n\n“We also believe Dr Harcourt’s comments with regards to potential health consequences are unhelpful and have the potential to create unnecessary stress and anxiety for players and their families,” the acting AFLPA boss said.\n\n“As has been reported, the Players’ Association has been working with the AFL and the club to implement a health protocol to monitor players’ health going forward.\n\n“However, to publicly speculate on any potential health issues in the absence of any evidence is premature and inappropriate.\n\n“We are seeking further information from the AFL in regards to Dr Harcourt’s comments.”\n\nSix months after the video, show-cause notices would be issued to 34 former and current Essendon players by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority.\n\nVIDEO REVEALS WHY AFL TEAMED UP WITH ASADA \n\n“One thing that we have to deal with, and this is the sobering element, my job now is to work out a program to monitor the players for the next five to 10 years because they were given such exotic substances — many of them growth factors — which means that we are looking at potential hormonal issues or cancers,” Harcourt said.\n\n“So now we have to go through a process of looking after this 35-odd players just to make sure that nothing really nasty happened to them from this crazy activity that individuals allowed to occur at the club.”\n\nHe told the conference Essendon’s governance in 2012 was “shocking” and that Bombers players did not “jack up” and protest against the drugs program.\n\n“There was shocking corporate governance over the team … club officials who were blind to their accountability and (there was) fan syndrome — so the leadership within the club were ex-players who were icons of the game,” he said.\n\n“And I think this intimidated a number of management staff. Basically we think there was a degree of fan syndrome in accepting the leadership knew what they were doing.\n\n“Athletes passively accepted the use — this shocked us. Players did not jack up and say ‘what the hell is going on?’.\n\n“There was probable use of performance enhancing drugs … there was clear risk of use.”\n\nHe explained why the AFL booted Essendon from last year’s finals before ASADA had finalised its case against the players.\n\n“We had to deal with the team in the context of the competition,” Harcourt said.\n\nHIRD MAKES EXPLOSIVE CLAIM AGAINST ASADA \n\n“We pushed for there to be some resolution about that in around about July/August because our finals are in September.\n\n“There was an urgency within the league ... which was an issue we had to confront with ASADA who were focused on building there anti-doping cases which take longer.\n\n“So in a sense we have separated those two issues, so that we can address the issues of the team, but keep the option open of dealing with the individuals with doping violations.\n\nHarcourt said human-growth hormone releasing substances; sections of the HGH molecule; a dementia therapy drug and veterinary products were used.\n\n“Most of the substances were just recently on to the WADA list or in the `and related substances’ sections of the list,” he said.\n\n“The individuals who were going about this were trying to exploit the nuances of the WADA list and probably also had some understanding that some of these substances were so new, that the laboratories didn’t have the capability of

The group received a $14,865 Lotterywest Grant last year to help with the development of a resource centre for community members living in Perth’s northern suburbs.\n\nWA players will have another chance to win big in Lotto tonight with Double Win Day.\n\nDouble Win Day will mean prizes across all Divisions in Wednesday Lotto (Draw 3361) will be doubled with a potential Division 1 winner taking home a topped up $2 million! Make sure to purchase your tickets by 6pm today to be in it to win it.\n\nTickets are available from Lotterywest retailers across WA, online and on mobile devices via Play Online at

then she went to bite him in the genital area,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think she made contact — he pulled away.\n\n“She then bit him on the hand — he had gloves on — and tried to spit at him.”\n\nThe bite broke the skin but did not puncture the glove.\n\nThe woman was then taken to Busselton Hospital, at her request, before being taken to Bunbury Regional Hospital for assessment and allegedly attacking the Senior Constable again in the carpark.\n\n“She has then scratched the officer on the forearm, drawing blood, and then she again attempted to bite him on the crotch,” Senior Sergeant Principe said.\n\nThe Senior Constable has had a blood test to check for communicable diseases and will have to wait three months for the result.\n\nThe woman, of no fixed address, was charged with two counts of assaulting a public officer and will face court at a later date.\n\n","byline":"CALLA WAHLQUIST

week and had amassed 729 likes by this morning.\n\nIt is linked to three other anti-mosque pages, including Stop the Mosque Bendigo which became national news last week after it was revealed it was funded by far-right lobby group Restore Australia.\n\nThe Stop the Mosque page, which bears the disclaimer, “no Islamic debate or trolls tolerated here,” has 727 followers.\n\nPosts on the page object to the suggestion that it is racist, saying “it is not racist to oppose a religion that is not compatible with our way of life.”\n\n“Islam is also NOT a religion. It is a dangerous, fascist political ideology like Nazism but it includes aspects of religion. For this reason, islam (sic) has been able to exploit our laws on religious freedom. If we are to defeat islam as we did Nazism, we have to put an end to this and strip islam (sic) of its status as a religion.\n\nWest Australians for Racial Equality president Suresh Rajan said content on the page was “extremely offensive.”\n\n“It’s clearly and obviously based on bigotry and religious vilification,” Mr Rajan said.\n\n“What’s scary is it got more than 700 likes in six days … it’s pretty frightening how quickly these things can proliferate.\n\n“I just wonder how these people would react if a similar sort of thing was said about their particular religion.”\n\nMr Rajan said the popularity of the page was “extremely disappointing, but not surprising.”\n\n“We haven’t really seen any strong leadership on this point from our political leaders to try and change this sort of behaviour,” he said.\n\nThe Kalgoorlie Islamic Community Centre lodged an application last month to build a mosque on Park Street. There are already Islamic centres offering a regular place to meet for prayer in the town.\n\nA Change.org petition linked to the Facebook page and calling on the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder to block the development application has already amassed more than 600 signatures.\n\nAmong the supporting statements offered by signatories were “because this is australia not arabia (sic)” and “until they assimilate I will NEVER agree to this.”\n\n“These people do not fit in with our culture and demand us to change! I am totally fed up!”\n\nThe City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has been contacted for comment\n\n","byline":"CALLA WAHLQUIST ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/western-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"perthnow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T01:53:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T10:40:46.000Z","description":"AN anti-Islamic Facebook page that opposes the construction of a mosque in Kalgoorlie has been branded as “based on bigotry” and “extremely offensive.”","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnii5tho-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"dailytelegraph.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnii5thq-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnii5thn-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"news.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnii5thm-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnhocxo3-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"perthnow.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnii5thp-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["dailytelegraph.com.au","couriermail.com.au","news.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","perthnow.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"37180251533082d2b1ba88288959385a","keywords":["development application","anti-mosque pages","far-right lobby group","page object","religious vilification","Facebook","Inc.","Suresh Rajan","religious freedom","regular place","fascist political ideology","particular religion","Kalgoorlie/Boulder","Western Australia","Australia","Kalgoorlie"],"link":"http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/stop-the-mosque-in-kalgoorlie-facebook-page-branded-extremely-offensive/story-fnhocxo3-1226973923441?sv=29f3aecb0261c722714057266bd04696","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973923441","originalAssetId":"1226973923441","originalSource":"PerthNow","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"ada91ebd9643026bc7cd463f34a083df","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973923724","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"AN anti-Islamic Facebook page that opposes the construction of a mosque in Kalgoorlie has been slammed as “bigotry”.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"‘Stop the Mosque in Kalgoorlie’ Facebook page branded ‘extremely offensive’","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"‘Offensive’ anti-mosque page slammed","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"a7f65484-00de-11e4-a199-d36e19f21cac - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["pride","Suresh Rajan"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/perthnow/images/1226974288971?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974288971","originalSource":"News Limited","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974286945","subtitle":"a7f65484-00de-11e4-a199-d36e19f21cac","title":" Pride of Australia medal ceremony.

ended up crashed on its side in the driveway of a house in Collie.\n\nPolice were called to the corner of Hester Avenue and Connolly Drive in Merriwa at 11.20pm last night on reports a car had crashed into a street light pole.\n\nAn ambulance was also called, but the driver refused treatment.\n\nThe driver was then taken to Clarkson Police Station, and allegedly showed a blood-alcohol content of more than 0.3 per cent.\n\nA spokesman for WA Police said the man collapsed at the police station as he was being processed and an ambulance was called to take him to Joondalup Health Campus.\n\n“Officers checked on the man at a later time and were advised he seemed OK, and was sleeping off his intoxication,” the WA Police spokesman said.\n\nThe man will be charged via summons.\n\nIn another incident, a 48-year-old Collie man was charged with exceeding 0.08 and having no authority to drive after the Mitsubishi Triton ute he was driving lost control and landed on its side in the driveway of a home in Collie.\n\nCollie Police spotted the ute on Prinsep Street about 10.45pm last night and swung around to follow it.\n\nThey lost sight of the ute over the crest of a hill and again around a right hand bend, before coming upon it lying on its side in the driveway of the home.\n\nPolice say it appeared to have crossed through the garden of one house, driven through a fence and struck a parked car, which then hit the house.\n\nThe windscreen had to be smashed out to free the trapped driver, and the crash cased structural damage to the house.\n\nThe man will appear in Collie Magistrates Court next week.\n\n","byline":"CALLA WAHLQUIST ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and

City of South Perth and the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale have joined a Vincent resident Ian Ker in the legal battle.\n\nThey claim Local Government Minister Tony Simpson’s proposal to slash the number of metropolitan councils from 30 to 15 is “unlawful”.\n\nLawyer John Hammond, who is representing the councils, was unable to say how much the court action would cost ratepayers.\n\nThe City of South Perth, which is proposed to be abolished and taken over by the Town of Victoria Park, has committed up to $100,000.\n\nSouth Perth councillors last week also voted for the new local government entity to be named South Park if the merger goes ahead next year.\n\nPerth council votes to rename itself South Park \n\nThe injunction bid is against Mr Simpson and the Local Government Advisory Board.\n\nIf granted, it could stop the board from considering Mr Simpson’s proposed boundary shake-up.\n\nThe Shire of Kalamunda confirmed it would provide financial support, but was not a named party in the action.\n\nMr Hammond told ABC radio this morning: “One of the arguments we run is that a number of councils that are about to be abolished, their electors do not have a say as to whether they should be abolished.\n\n“That means they can’t go to a poll. We’re saying all councils and all electors should be able to go to a poll to make a decision on this.\n\n“It’s important to remember that some of these local governments have been in existence for 100 years or more and to suddenly wipe them off the map isn’t something that should happen with just the stroke of a pen.”\n\nPremier Colin Barnett has previously warned councils against wasting ratepayers’ money on court action.\n\nLocal Government Minister Tony Simpson said he was in Port Hedland today and had yet to see what the legal action actually entails.\n\n“What I will say is that the Liberal-National Government remains committed and focused on the ultimate goal – strengthening the capacity and sustainability of local governments so they can deliver high-quality services to their communities,” he said.\n\n“Ultimately, it’s up to the community to decide if their councils joining costly legal action against the State Government is a good use of their ratepayer dollars. If they lose, ratepayers could be liable for court costs, and the expenses could be very large.\n\n“The South Perth community, in particular, would be understandably confused by this announcement. On the one hand, we’ve seen great engagement between the council and their community to name the new ‘South Park’ or ‘South Bank’.\n\n“On the other, we’ve got the same council joining legal action to stop mergers.”\n\nHe said the board, due to make its recommendations to him shortly, would continue its deliberations.\n\n“Local government reform has been talked about for years. I am confident the process we have followed is in line with the provisions of the Local Government Act,” he said.\n\n“I am absolutely committed to seeing this process through.”\n\nSouth Perth Mayor Sue Doherty said the council would continue to work closely with Victoria Park in an amalgamation process in good faith.\n\n“While supportive of reform in general, the council and our community have repeatedly been let down by the State Government process,” Mayor Doherty said.\n\n“The City has strongly objected to the Minister’s proposals to transfer part of the Burswood Peninsula into the City of Perth as well as abolish and disestablish the City of South Perth and have it taken over by our neighbours at the Town of Victoria Park.\n\n“The most recent decision of the Government to allocate a miserly $15 million over three years for the Local Government Reform process for the whole of the metropolitan area is grossly inadequate.\n\n“The State Government is blatantly disregarding its responsibility to meet the costs of the process that it has initiated.”\n\n","byline":"PETER LAW ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News

today warned our favourite devices were “Petri dishes for disease and germs.”\n\nThe shortest day of the year may already be behind us, but Health Department WA data suggests WA’s influenza season is only just starting.\n\nAMA WA president Michael Gannon said mobile phone hygiene was crucial to warding off the flu.\n\n“The winter flu season is just starting and people should remember the checklist of ways to\n\nprevent catching or passing on the flu,” he said. said.\n\n“Mobile phones are one of our most used personal items and have become Petri dishes for\n\ndisease and germs.\n\n“We have to remember that we take our mobile phones everywhere — from our beds to our\n\nkitchens, to work and to the toilet.\n\n“Studies have shown that mobile phones are dirtier than toilet seats, and are one the\n\ndirtiest things we come in contact with on a daily basis.\n\n“We pass our phones around to our children, our friends and work colleagues and our\n\ngerms can soon become their diseases.”\n\nDr Gannon said recent studies had shown one-in-six mobile phones contained traces of E. coli bateria.\n\nHe said the best way to ensure your phone was germ-free was to use antibacterial wipes every few weeks, or to roll your mobile phone in your hands after using hand sanitiser.\n\nThe flu usually kills around 2800 Australians every year — more than the national road toll, Dr Gannon said.\n\n“We

These little ladies, only 14 and 15, are the most bubbly, outgoing, funny teenagers who should not be battling what they are at their age.\n\nThese girls have had their teenage years taken away from them by these horrible diseases.\n\nThey should be out with their girlfriends chasing boys on weekends. They should be spending their days at school running amuck with their mates.\n\nNot held up in hospital watching movies fighting for their lives.\n\nIt’s not fair that they have to go through this. It’s not fair they have to lose their hair, it’s not fair that they can’t be kids and it’s not fair that they have to spend hours, days and sometimes weeks at Princess Margaret Hospital.\n\nI’m extremely lucky to have met Caitlin and Chloe, as it really hammers home that my worries in life are very small compared to what they’re going through on a daily basis.\n\nI still remember the very first time I met them, their smiles lit up the entire room at PMH. When I think about them many words come to mind; inspirational, brave, courageous, beautiful, determined, strong, funny, hopeful, and caring. \n\nThese girls have inspired me and I’m thankful they’ve come into my life.\n\nAfter the first time I met them I went home upset that I couldn’t help them. I was upset that this was happening to them.\n\nI spent hours that afternoon asking: Why has this happened to them? Why do they have to go through this?\n\nThe one reason I kept coming back to was because we need people like these girls in our lives to inspire us.\n\nWe need strong, brave, beautiful, courageous girls like Chloe and Caitlin to give us hope.\n\nI’m in no way saying what they are going through is OK; I was just searching for some kind of answer.\n\nHalf the battle for Caitlin and Chloe is their need for blood. Your blood.\n\nWithin the past year alone Chloe has had 34 platelets and 29 blood transfusions and Caitlin over 45 procedures for both.\n\nThis is vital for their survival and for many others.\n\nOn numerous occasions the Australian Red Cross Blood Service has been short of blood, meaning these girls have been left waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And waiting, for help.\n\nThis is hugely stressful for them and their loved ones.\n\nSo what I’m asking of everyone, is to please roll up your sleeve today and donate blood.\n\nEvery donation helps save three lives. \n\nDid you know one in three people need blood but only one in 30 people donate?\n\nGo on, do it today, call 13 95 96 to make an appointment or head to www.donateblood.com.au\n\nNo matter how sick these girls are, they can always crack a cheeky smile.\n\nI reckon that’s because they have the most loving family and friends surrounding them who have not left their bedsides for the entire battle.\n\nTheir parents are beautiful in nature, determination and strength and I believe this shines through with these girls.\n\nI hope one day you are lucky enough to meet Caitlin and Chloe.\n\nThey will change your life. They have changed mine and I’m so lucky I can call them both my friend.\n\n","byline":"Heidi Anderson 92.9FM","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Opinion/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and Galleries/","/display/perthnow.com.au/PerthNow/PN Top News/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/","/section/news.com.au/national/western-australia/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/news/national/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/","/section/perthnow.com.au/news/opinion/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"perthnow.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T16:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T08:09:35.000Z","description":"I USED to believe that everything happens for a reason.

which shows 11,768 pupils were suspended in 2013.\n\nThat represented 4.3 per cent of all students — and compares with 11,715, or 4.4 per cent of all pupils, in 2012.\n\nPhysical assault or intimidation of other students accounted for 30 per cent of last year’s suspensions, followed by violation of school rules (28.2 per cent), verbal abuse or harassment of staff (17 per cent), and physical assault or intimidation of staff (7.6 per cent).\n\nTwenty students were also excluded from school in 2013 for particularly bad behaviour — a significant decline from a high of 54 exclusions in 2010.\n\nA spokesman for the Education Department said “schools have access to a range of interventions to address the challenging behaviour of students before resorting to suspension and exclusion”.\n\n“The percentage of students suspended has decreased by 0.5 per cent since 2010,” he said.\n\n“Despite a significant increase in the student population, 430 fewer students were suspended in 2013 than in 2010.\n\n“The number of students excluded has been falling consistently and significantly from 54 in 2010 to 20 in 2013.\n\n“An exclusion order is the most extreme sanction that can be applied to a student in a public school and is reserved for the most serious and disruptive behaviour.”\n\n","byline":"YASMINE PHILLIPS Education

biggest and most important day of the year, Mr Shorten will be addressing the party faithful in New Zealand.\n\nThe New Zealand Labour Party’s ‘Putting People First’ annual congress agenda has Mr Shorten speaking on Sunday, July 6 at 11.50am.\n\nMr Shorten was invited to attend this weekend’s WA Labor state conference but instead, headed to New Zealand.\n\nLast year Mr Shorten went on holidays instead of attending WA Labor’s state conference.\n\nPrivately, senior Labor figures are angry that Mr Shorten will be a no show this weekend.\n\nHis non-appearance comes just a few months after Labor lost a WA senator — Louise Pratt — in the federal parliament because of a low vote.\n\nThis weekend’s state Labor conference is being held at Ascot Racecourse.\n\nA statement from Mr Shorten’s office said the minister was “unfortunately unable to attend the WA State Conference due to commitments in New Zealand.”\n\nThe snub has infuriated senior members of the WA Labor Party, who are desperate for success after six years in the political abyss.\n\n“First Julia (Gillard) wouldn’t come, now Billy,” a senior Labor MP told PerthNow.\n\n“It’s incumbent on every federal leader to make every effort to come to what is WA Labor’s showcase on the political agenda.\n\n“And certainly it’s disappointing\n\n“It shows that wounds of (Julia) Gillard, (Kevin) Rudd and the WA Labor Party haven’t healed.\n\n“It means there is a lot more work to be done restoring that relationship.\n\n“Him (Bill Shorten) being new — you would have thought he would have wanted to come over for the conference.”\n\nAnother senior Labor source told PerthNow: “When he was here for the senate election he made all these promises about being a regular visitor to WA.\n\n“Not being here for state conference sends out mixed messages.”\n\nThe agenda for this weekend’s state conference shows shadow assistant health minister Stephen Jones will address the gathering instead.\n\n“Who?” one senior Labor source said, mocking the decision to replace Shorten with Jones.\n\nLabor leader Mark McGowan will address the conference on the Sunday, at which he is expected to give details of party reform — including giving branch members a say in electing the leader of the WA Labor Party is and giving them a bigger say in preselections.\n\nLabor has lost two state and two federal elections in WA since 2008.\n\nIt holds just 21 out of 59 seats in the WA Legislative Assembly and just three out of 15 federal seats.\n\nLabor sources said the conference was “crucial” for Mr McGowan, as he prepared for the 2017 state election.\n\n","byline":"JOE SPAGNOLO ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/PerthNow/PN WA News and

A consequence of the move could be that their names are disclosed at some stage during the trial.\n\nLawyers for the AFL Players’ Association, which is representing the 34 players, have until 10.15am on Friday to decide whether to join voluntarily or face the prospect of being included at the orders of the court. The players’ legal team is headed by David Grace QC.\n\n“As Mr Grace QC made clear in court this morning, the players’ key concern is their anonymity,” AFLPA acting CEO Ian Prendergast said.\n\n“Despite speculation as to which players have received show-cause notices, the 34 players have not been named, and nor should they. The players do not believe that the action taken by the club and James Hird — the involvement in which they resisted — should change this.”\n\nJustice Middleton today ruled a tranche of secret ASADA documents about the joint investigation and its agreements with the AFL must be released to Essendon’s lawyers.\n\nThe swathe of documents would include ASADA’s interim report and any document between the AFL and ASADA related to the drafting and publication of the interim report. Hird’s legal team was given the green light to subpoena the AFL and its integrity chief Brett Clothier to supply them with some documents it received and sent to ASADA.\n\nBut the main argument was if the players themselves would be forced to join the proceedings and then publicly outed.\n\nDavid Grace QC acting for the players said they would suffer “irreparable reputational harm” if their identities were disclosed.\n\nHe said the players would not join the club and its coach James Hird in its action against ASADA joint investigation unless their anonymity could be guaranteed.\n\nMr Grace said he would seek suppression orders for the player if they were named as parties in the case.\n\nJustice Middleton did not rule out forcing the players to join the action as respondents and said while he understood the difficult position they were in, “hard decisions” would have to be made.\n\nJustice Middleton said the issue of joining players would be resolved on Friday.\n\nHe also flagged that Essendon and Hird’s lawyers should be provided with the documents ASADA chief Ben McDevitt used to make his decision to issue the show-cause notices.\n\nDaniel Star acting for ASADA revealed to the court there were 45,000 documents which could be relevant to the court action under discovery. He said the agency would provide a full defence to Essendon’s lawyers by July 9.\n\nThe direction hearing will continue on Friday.\n\nEarlier, lawyers for 34 former and current Bombers issued with doping show-cause notices met players yesterday to discuss the move.\n\n“We are working through a process with the players to determine whether they (the players) are willing to be joined as a party to the proceedings,” AFL Players’ Association acting chief Ian Prendergast told the Herald Sun last night.\n\n“It is still being considered by the legal team. While we weren’t interested in being joined to the action initially, we understand any decision made by the Federal Court will impact on the interests of players.”\n\nThe move came as suspended Bombers coach James Hird yesterday declared players and officials were robbed of the right to stay silent during interviews with AFL and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority investigators.\n\nIn documents lodged with the Federal Court, Hird claimed the Bombers should have been afforded “the common law right against self-incrimination”.\n\nInstead, Hird says, players and officials were “under threat of censure and sanction” from the AFL if they did not “answer every question asked”.\n\nNew details of the legal challenges mounted against ASADA by Essendon and Hird were revealed in documents lodged by both camps ahead of today’s Federal Court hearing.\n\nThe Bombers, Hird and ASADA will return to court at 10.15am to finalise which documents must be made available to parties and whether the players will join.\n\nFederal Court Justice John Middleton could also be asked to rule on an application by Hird for AFL integrity boss Brett Clothier to provide documents and give evidence in the witness box.\n\nA statement of claim lodged by Hird yesterday included the allegation that ASADA provided draft versions of its interim report to the AFL before it was completed.\n\nThe report was used by the AFL Commission as the basis for the heaviest penalties in football history slapped on the Bombers on August 27 last year.\n\n“On dates known to the respondent, ASADA provided drafts or versions of the Interim Report or parts thereof to the AFL,” the Hird statement alleges.\n\nHird’s statement claims that his legal team raised concerns about the validity of the AFL-ASADA investigation at the start of his interview at Etihad Stadium on April 16 last year.\n\nIt includes an exchange between Hird’s former legal counsel Tony Nolan SC and AFL investigator Abraham Haddad.\n\nNolan: “Now, gentlemen, we don’t want to enter into any debate as to the legal arguments today as to the nature of the joint investigation as distinct from two separate investigations. We’ll put that debate to the side for a later time, if necessary.”\n\nHaddad: “Okay. That’s good.”\n\nNolan: “We understand that’s what you say.”\n\nHird is studying in France and will return to Melbourne on July 28.

Organise a photograph with an AFL footballer and a woman in skimpy clothes and you have yourself a spot in the newspaper to promote your latest product/cause/event.\n\nIt could be anything from flavoured milk to ballet, but the formula has been used over and over again through the years.\n\nSo this week Retrogram has delved into the vault to find a few classic examples. If you can think of any we’ve missed, post a comment below or get in contact through Twitter at @_warwickgreen  and we’ll publish a selection next week.\n\n1. DERMIE AND MILK\n\nVictoria’s ailing dairy industry found a way to turn around its fortunes in the 1970s when it came up with the Big M concept. And a huge part of its marketing was “Big M Girls’’. How else was up-and-coming Hawks star Dermott Brereton going to manage to drink his carton of Big Chocolate back in 1983?\n\n2. LETHAL AND MORE MILK\n\nAnd without the help of Big M, Hawthorn skipper Leigh Matthews clearly would have struggled with this enormous football-shaped cake in 1982.\n\n3. KB AND TEA \n\nThe question is, did Kevin Bartlett take milk in his tea? Here he is pictured at Punt Rd Oval in 1980, getting a little help to promote Richmond’s sponsor, Tetley, and its upcoming Tetley Tea Party.\n\n4. KOUTA, ANGE AND TOY CARS\n\nCarlton pair Anthony Koutoufides and Ange Christou took time from pre-season training in 1999 to hop on to a Harley-Davidson with Hot Wheels representative Bianca Ross. Something to do with Hot Wheels sponsoring the V8 Supercar Showdown at the Australian Grand Prix apparently.\n\n5. RHYCE SHAW AND FAST CARS\n\nAnd while we’re on the Formula 1 and grid girls theme, then-Collingwood footballer Rhyce Shaw found himself at Fed Square in 2004. What else would you do but volunteer to have your head shaved by Fosters and Gillette GP reps Ana, Mieke and Katie and then hop into the cockpit of an FI car? Thumbs up, Rhyce.\n\n6. SAM AND LACE\n\nWhen Geelong ruckman Sam Newman wanted to display the Cats’ snappy lace-up guernsey in 1973, he enlisted the help of a model. Just so that we could compare it to the conventional woollen number, you understand.\n\n7. NICK RIEWOLDT AND BEER\n\nA decade ago the young Saints forward posed in this photo with VB Girls Julia Tink and Elisha Missen to help promote the Great Aussie Legends Evening at the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda. What that actually involved was beer tasting with more than 650 publicans. Tough gig.\n\n8. LLOYDY AND MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nAlso in 2004, Essendon’s Matthew Lloyd took time out from the forward line to join the chorus line. The photo at the top of this page was a cross promotion, with dancers from the musical comedy The Producers giving their show a kick along, while at the same time sporting the colours of the teams playing in that year’s finals series.\n\n9. KEKA AND BOOTS\n\nLong before he became a “lambassador’’, North Melbourne star Sam Kekovich was turning his attention to flogging products. Back in 1969 Keka enlisted the help of HSV7 ballet girls Joan Brockenshire and Heather Warnecke, presumably to promote the new range of locally made White Diamond football boots, famously worn by the likes of Peter Huddson, Ian Stewart and Ted Whitten.\n\n10. ST KILDA AND … NOT SURE REALLY\n\nNo. Not a clue, to be honest. The year was 1982 and for some reason St Kilda footballers Darryl Hewitt (26 career games) and Wayne Slattery (11) were out on the Moorabbin turf with a wheelbarrow, in which sat a bikini-clad, high-heeled model. Unless the Saints had just signed a sponsorship deal with a wheelbarrow manufacturer, it’s hard to know how this photograph ever came to be.\n\nRETROGRAM RECALL\n\nFROM Countryfootyscores on Twitter: How rural for the Retrogram country footy list? Leigh Matthews qualifies because Chelsea is in the Mornington Peninsula Football League.\n\nRETROGRAM SAYS: Fair suggestion, but I can’t have it. Chelsea is metro for mine. If you call it rural you have to say that St Kilda (which is further down the line at Seaford) is a country footy club.\n\nFROM Tigerbob on Twitter: What about Graham Arthur and Fred Swift from Sandhurst?\n\nRETROGRAM SAYS: Both outstanding players, who captained their clubs (Hawthorn and Richmond respectively) to premierships in the 1960s, but I couldn’t squeeze them in.\n\n","byline":"Warwick Green ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/Fox Sports AFL News/","/display/theaustralian.com.au/Sport/Fox Sports Latest news/","/display/foxsports.com.au/AFL/AFL Premiership/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/","/display/foxsports.com.au/AFL/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Media i/","/display/foxsports.com.au/Homepage/Latest News/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/news.com.au/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/perthnow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL Teams/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/Sport news and galleries/All Sports/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/","/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/","/section/theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl-new/","/section/foxsports.com.au/afl/","/section/foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/","/section/couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/news.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/","/section/perthnow.com.au/sport/afl/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T10:00:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T06:53:49.000Z","description":"IT WAS Elvis Presley who sang “Girls, in tight sweaters, girls, in short dresses, a walkin’ and wigglin’ by’’ in his 1962 song Girls!

HAWTHORN\n\n44pts 147.9%\n\nR16: North Melbourne (Etihad) W\n\nR17: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR18: Sydney (MCG) W\n\nR19: Western Bulldogs (Aurora) W\n\nR20: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR21: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR22: Geelong (MCG) W\n\nR23: Collingwood (MCG) W\n\nMatt says: This Hawthorn side just does not know how to lose despite everything that has been thrown at it. Remarkably remains in the box seat to claim top spot and now gets its coach and potentially one of its best players (Sam Mitchell) back. Still to play five of the teams currently in the top eight plus Adelaide away, but would only likely not start favourite in one of those games (Fremantle at Patersons).\n\n2. PORT ADELAIDE\n\n44pts 141.9%\n\nR16: Essendon (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR17: Richmond (Etihad) W\n\nR18: Melbourne (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR19: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR20: Sydney (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR21: Gold Coast (Metricon) W\n\nR22: Carlton (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR23: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nMatt says: Could have almost locked up the minor premiership with a win over Sydney three weeks ago, now a top two spot is looking anything but secure after losses to the Swans and Adelaide. Securing a home qualifying final has to be the goal. From there, can you imagine what a preliminary final at a packed Adelaide Oval would be like?\n\nRE-LIVE THE CHAT AND HAVE YOUR SAY BELOW\n\n3. SYDNEY\n\n44pts 137.9%\n\nR16: West Coast (Patersons) W\n\nR17: Carlton (SCG) W\n\nR18: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR19: Essendon (SCG) W\n\nR20: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR21: St Kilda (SCG) W\n\nR22: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR23: Richmond (ANZ) W\n\nMatt says: Premiership favourites with Hawthorn and deservedly so based on its last two and a half months. Still, Sydney is no certainty to finish top two given the draws of Hawthorn, Port Adelaide and Fremantle. Luckily for the Swans, they play the Hawks and Power on the run home so they can shape their own destiny. Unluckily though they have to play them both away. Could it be that we’re still talking about that costly Round 1 loss to GWS come the end of the season?\n\n4. FREMANTLE\n\n40pts 132%\n\nR16: Melbourne (TIO) W\n\nR17: GWS (Patersons) W\n\nR18: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Carlton (Patersons) W\n\nR20: Geelong (Simonds) L\n\nR21: Hawthorn (Patersons) W\n\nR22: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR23: Port Adelaide (Patersons) W\n\nMatt says: The derby win for an undermanned Fremantle was massive because it doesn’t play another side currently in the top eight until Round 20, by which stage it could have virtually locked up the double chance. Clashes with Geelong (away), Hawthorn and Port Adelaide (home) in the last month will determine the top two fate of last year’s runner-up.\n\n5. GEELONG\n\n40pts 106.8%\n\nR16: Western Bulldogs (Simonds) W\n\nR17: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR18: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR19: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR20: Fremantle (Simonds) W\n\nR21: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR23: Brisbane Lions (Simonds) W\n\nMatt says: Great draw to come, one that is rated as one of the easiest by Champion Data. But Geelong’s loss to Gold Coast a couple of weeks ago puts it well and truly on the back foot in terms of taking a spot in the top four. The Cats will have to win at least one, if not two, of their games against North Melbourne (Etihad), Fremantle (Simonds) an Hawthorn (MCG) to have any realistic hope of securing the double chance.\n\n6. COLLINGWOOD\n\n36pts 114.1%\n\nR16: Gold Coast (Metricon) L\n\nR17: Essendon (MCG) W\n\nR18: Adelaide (MCG) W\n\nR19: Port Adelaide (MCG) W\n\nR20: West Coast (Patersons) W\n\nR21: Brisbane Lions (MCG) W\n\nR22: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR23: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nMatt says: Popular consensus suggests Collingwood’s top four hopes were shot the minute it dropped the game it shouldn’t have against the Western Bulldogs. Given the draw ahead, the Magpies are probably just a rung below those sides anyway. May already be sizing up a week one elimination final at the MCG against any one of North Melbourne, Geelong or Gold Coast by virtue of finishing between fifth and seventh.\n\n7. NORTH MELBOURNE\n\n32pts 110%\n\nR16: Hawthorn (Etihad) L\n\nR17: St Kilda (Blundstone) W\n\nR18: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Geelong (Etihad) W\n\nR20: GWS (Startrack) W\n\nR21: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Adelaide (Blundstone) W\n\nR23: Melbourne (Etihad) W\n\nMatt says: North Melbourne has, according to Champion Data, the easiest run home of any team in the AFL. The question though is does that rating take in to account the inconsistencies of the Kangaroos? Hawthorn and Geelong stick out as the only two really difficult games left for Brad Scott’s men, who are still every chance of pushing further up the ladder despite the weekend’s shock loss to the Brisbane Lions.\n\n8. GOLD COAST\n\n32pts 101.2%\n\nR16: Collingwood (Metricon) W\n\nR17: Western Bulldogs (Cazaly’s) W\n\nR18: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR19: St Kilda (Metricon) W\n\nR20: Carlton (Etihad) W\n\nR21: Port Adelaide (Metricon) L\n\nR22: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR23: West Coast (Metricon) W\n\nMatt says: Gold Coast is surely now headed for its first finals series after a historic win against Geelong a fortnight ago. Given the expectations around the Suns now, they should be favourites in home games against Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast and away games against the Western Bulldogs (Cairns), Brisbane Lions (Gabba) and Carlton (Etihad). Wins in five of those games, maybe even four depending on percentage, should be enough to clinch a September berth.\n\n9. ADELAIDE\n\n28pts 105%\n\nR16: GWS (Spotless) W\n\nR17: Hawthorn (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR18: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR19: West Coast (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR20: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) W\n\nR21: Richmond (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nR22: North Melbourne (Blundstone) L\n\nR23: St Kilda (Adelaide Oval) W\n\nMatt says: A shock win in the Showdown on the weekend puts Adelaide back in the hunt to make the eight. The Crows have now won seven of their past 11 games and should make that eight from 12 against Greater Western Sydney this week, which could catapult it — for a week at least — in to eighth. But from there it gets hard. Hawthorn (home) and Collingwood (away) are challenging games while Gold Coast takes on the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions, while North Melbourne in Tassie also lies in waiting down the track. Can’t afford any slip-ups.\n\n10. ESSENDON\n\n28pts 104.9%\n\nR16: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR17: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR18: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) W\n\nR19: Sydney (SCG) L\n\nR20: Richmond (MCG) W\n\nR21: West Coast (Etihad) W\n\nR22: Gold Coast (Etihad) W\n\nR23: Carlton (MCG) W\n\nMatt says: Unfortunately, like last year, the great unknown about Essendon is not so much its fixture but how it will fare in terms of the ongoing supplements saga. All things being even, and if the Bombers are performing to their optimum, then the draw presents the club with a chance to make the finals despite it being rated as the toughest run home of any side. But, like Adelaide, the Bombers can’t afford any more slip-ups ahead of the Round 22 clash with Gold Coast. An upset victory over either Port Adelaide (away) this week or Collingwood next week would be a big help.\n\n11. WEST COAST\n\n24pts 110.6%\n\nR16: Sydney (Patersons) L\n\nR17: Brisbane Lions (Gabba) L\n\nR18: Richmond (Patersons) W\n\nR19: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR20: Collingwood (Patersons) L\n\nR21: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Melbourne (Patersons) W\n\nR23: Gold Coast (Metricon) L\n\nMatt says: Couldn’t do what Adelaide did — win a game against the odds against its cross-town rivals. Big percentage remains a factor, but realistically now West Coast’s hopes of making the finals are gone. The Eagles have, after all, only won three games since winning their first three matches of the season.\n\n12. WESTERN BULLDOGS\n\n20pts 82.4%\n\nR16: Geelong (Simonds) L\n\nR17: Gold Coast (Cazaly’s) L\n\nR18: Essendon (Etihad) L\n\nR19: Hawthorn (Aurora) L\n\nR20: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR21: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Sydney (Etihad) L\n\nR23: GWS (Etihad) W\n\nMatt says: Great win against Melbourne on the weekend. Beyond that though, only the most ardent of Western Bulldogs fans would argue it should start favourite in any game other than those against St Kilda and perhaps Greater Western Sydney.\n\n13. RICHMOND\n\n16pts 96.5%\n\nR16: Brisbane Lions (MCG) W\n\nR17: Port Adelaide (Etihad) L\n\nR18: West Coast (Patersons) L\n\nR19: GWS (MCG) W\n\nR20: Essendon (MCG) L\n\nR21: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR22: St Kilda (MCG) W\n\nR23: Sydney (ANZ) L\n\nMatt says: Finally Richmond has a bit of breathing space between itself and the wooden spoon. The draw actually doesn’t look too bad for the Tigers. A few wins against the likes of Brisbane Lions (MCG), Greater Western Sydney (MCG) and St Kilda (MCG) again may paper over some of the cracks, but at least they will put smiles on the faces of a few fans ahead of a long, hot summer.\n\n14. CARLTON\n\n16pts 87.1%\n\nR16: St Kilda (Etihad) W\n\nR17: Sydney (SCG) L\n\nR18: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR19: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR20: Gold Coast (Etihad) L\n\nR21: Geelong (Etihad) L\n\nR22: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR23: Essendon (MCG) L\n\nMatt says: Shaping as being the season of ‘What ifs?’ for Carlton given close losses to Richmond (12 points), Greater Western Sydney (eight), Brisbane Lions (seven), Geelong (five), GWS (eight) and Collingwood (15). Finals chances were officially extinguished, if they weren’t already, with the loss to the Giants two weeks back.\n\n15. MELBOURNE\n\n16pts 78.1%\n\nR16: Fremantle (TIO) L\n\nR17: Geelong (MCG) L\n\nR18: Port Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nR19: Brisbane Lions (Etihad) W\n\nR20: Hawthorn (MCG) L\n\nR21: GWS (MCG) L\n\nR22: West Coast (Patersons) L\n\nR23: North Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nMatt says: For the first time since 2007 Melbourne has beaten each of Essendon, Carlton and Richmond in a season. The form the Demons have displayed this year suggested they would take a top eight scalp at some stage, but perhaps the team is showing signs of tiring in the last couple of weeks.\n\n16. GREATER WESTERN SYDNEY\n\n16pts 77%\n\nR16: Adelaide (Spotless) L\n\nR17: Fremantle (Patersons) L\n\nR18: Geelong (Spotless) L\n\nR19: Richmond (MCG) L\n\nR20: North Melbourne (Startrack) L\n\nR21: Melbourne (MCG) W\n\nR22: Collingwood (Spotless) L\n\nR23: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) L\n\nMatt says: You can’t sit here now and say with any confidence that Greater Western Sydney should start favourite in any of its remaining games. But you also know that the Giants will win again, at least once, somewhere, because their kids are just too good not to. Games against Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs in the last three rounds will be interesting tests.\n\n17. BRISBANE LIONS\n\n16pts 62%\n\nR16: Richmond (MCG) L\n\nR17: West Coast (Gabba) W\n\nR18: Gold Coast (Gabba) L\n\nR19: Melbourne (Etihad) L\n\nR20: Adelaide (Gabba) L\n\nR21: Collingwood (MCG) L\n\nR22: Fremantle (Gabba) L\n\nR23: Geelong (Simonds) L\n\nMatt says: Gabba form — loss to GWS aside — has been relatively good this year. Game at home against West Coast and potentially trips to Victoria to play Richmond and Melbourne present the most realistic opportunities to avoid the wooden spoon.\n\n18. ST KILDA\n\n12pts 59.6%\n\nR16: Carlton (Etihad) L\n\nR17: North Melbourne (Blundstone) L\n\nR18: Fremantle (Etihad) L\n\nR19: Gold Coast (Metricon) L\n\nR20: Western Bulldogs (Etihad) L\n\nR21: Sydney (SCG) L\n\nR22: Richmond (MCG) L\n\nR23: Adelaide (Adelaide Oval) L\n\nMatt says: The warm favourites to win the wooden spoon now after the Brisbane Lions’ win on the weekend. No one thought it would end this way after St Kilda won three of its first four games, but the draw does look bleak from here.\n\nMATT WINDLEY’S PREDICTED LADDER\n\n1. Hawthorn 18-4\n\n2.

It has drawn people who did not know the dead woman but were deeply affected by her plight.\n\nA cyclist on her way to work left a card that read: “We are so sorry for the sadness and loss that your family is experiencing. Our city grieves with you and for you. I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe woman, who also did not know the victim, said it was time Melbourne united and stood up to the violence plaguing the city.\n\n“I think the message that’s coming to us is we’re not safe on the way to work, on the way home from work, out cycling or going for a run,” she said.\n\n“It’s time as women, and men, we stand up and say no to this violence.”\n\nAnother woman touched by the death wiped away tears as she left a note addressed to the victim.\n\n“Dear unknown girl,” she wrote. “I’m sorry you had to lose your life in an unknown country at the hands of an evil mad man.\n\n“I hope you managed to have some fun in your young life and lots of love.\n\n“Although I didn’t know you, I will think of you everyday as I pass this spot.”\n\nMs Lau’s employer at a city chocolate shop said she had worked there since May 2012.\n\n“She worked in our kitchen as a valued member of our pastry team. She will be terribly missed here.\n\n“She was a wonderful person and a beautiful friend and colleague.\n\n“We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.\n\nHe added: “She was a beautiful, lovely person and will be sorely missed.”\n\nA friend who was laying flowers near the crime scene in Kings Domain told the Herald Sun: “I really liked her smile. She had a beautiful smile.

claimed earlier this year that a union official was given a free roof for his home in exchange for industrial peace.\n\nThe whistleblower, Andrew Zaf, was hit with a piece of wood and stabbed in the

Life has been ordered to refund Sofia Baltatzidis her membership fee after a representative failed to show at a Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal hearing yesterday.\n\nThe Malvern businesswoman joined the service in January 2011 hoping to snare an “intelligent, caring, down-to-earth, genuine” partner.\n\n“It’s hard to meet intelligent people. Every time you go on the RSVP website all they talk about is star signs and footy,” Ms Baltatzidis told the Herald Sun.\n\nMs Baltatzidis claimed a consultant insisted on introducing her to a primary school teacher despite her objection that he wasn’t suitable for her.\n\n“When I called him he was unappealing and completely negative about his experience with Blue Label Life,” she claimed.\n\n“He had no personality, no humour, no spark. He was a bit of a boring sod.”\n\nShe claimed she never heard from a second candidate and a phone introduction to another man proved unsuitable as he lived in Jan Juc and was a “weirdo”.\n\nThe consultant described the men as “wonderful, successful” and “genuine gentlemen” who were excited to meet Ms Baltatzidis.\n\nMs Baltatzidis said Blue Label Life sent her two more profiles of men it said were “extremely compatible” with her in July 2011 despite her demands for a refund, which the agency refused.\n\nBlue Label Life claims all matches are “scientifically compatible” and hand-picked from an “extensive and elite pool of members”.\n\nDirector Samantha Jayne said she wasn’t notified of the VCAT hearing and a review of the order has since been recommended.\n\nMs Jayne said Ms Baltatzidis was given numerous opportunities to meet with suitable candidates.\n\n“Between July 2011 and December 2011 I personally tried to engage with Ms Baltatzidis and to work out a way forward or a resolution to her issue, but Ms Baltatzidis’ behaviour and what we felt at the time were unreasonable demands made it impossible for a resolution to be found,” she told the Herald Sun.\n\nangus.thompson@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"ANGUS THOMPSON ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and

early morning shift when the unthinkable began to unfold.\n\nVideo footage from the cameras of high-end residential complex The Melburnian, which capture St Kilda Rd, show a woman running from a man before dawn on Saturday morning.\n\nThe confrontation on the street before Ms Lau was chased down is still unknown.\n\nIt will be the police case Ms Lau was confronted by accused man Scott Allen Miller as he walked home from a night at Bourke St hotel The Carlton after he was ejected about 5am.\n\nWhat is known is Ms Lau was a devout Baptist Christian who was enjoying life in Melbourne. Although it is believed she had no family in Melbourne, Ms Lau, a Chinese national, had made industry friends here, particularly at the William Angliss Institute.\n\nBut those who placed cards and flowers at the site of her death were mainly from her church, who remembered Ms Lau for her faith and her smile.\n\nFellow colleagues of Renea Lau said she was a “beautiful, lovely person” who will be sorely missed.\n\n“It is with deep sadness that we can confirm Renea Lau was an employee here,” Steven Kearney, her employer, said.\n\n“She’s been with us since May 2012. She worked in our kitchen as a valued member of our pastry team. She will be terribly missed here.\n\n“She was a wonderful person and a beautiful friend and colleague.\n\n“We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.\n\nHe added: “She was a beautiful, lovely person and will be sorely missed. It is a difficult time for us and we do not wish to comment further.”\n\nIn contrast, the riches to rags story of Mr Miller had led him to Melbourne’s Janet Lady Clarke rotunda, opposite the tan track.\n\nHe had fallen on hard times since running a nightclub in the 1990s and reportedly until a couple of months ago was living in a shed on a property in Darwin and making didgeridoos.\n\nIt will be alleged their paths met for the first and only time as they walked along the tree-lined St Kilda Rd - one of Melbourne’s busiest streets.\n\nThe cameras capture Ms Lau running towards Kings Domain. Hours later a jogger would find her battered body near the Victoria Police Memorial.\n\nHomicide investigators had the awful task of informing Ms Lau’s siblings of her death, who in turn told her parents.\n\nHer alleged attacker was apprehended after a three-day manhunt sleeping on rocks in the southern NSW coastal town of Eden.\n\nMr Miller’s extradition to Victoria was granted by a Batemans Bay magistrate and he was flown to Melbourne for questioning at the St Kilda Road Police Complex today.\n\nMr Miller will appear in court tomorrow after he is remanded at the Melbourne Custody Centre.\n\nFriends and complete strangers returned to the scene of Ms Lau’s murder today.\n\nDespite not knowing the dead woman, a local resident who wished only to be known as Rod was so touched by her death that he laid a bunch of yellow flowers just metres from where her body was found before holding a minute’s silence.\n\n“It’s terrible. I really feel sorry for her parents,” he said.\n\n“It shouldn’t have happened here. It’s a beautiful spot.”\n\nA cyclist on her way to work left a card that read: “We are so sorry for the sadness and loss that your family is experiencing.\n\n“Our city grieves with you and for you. I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe woman, who also did not know the victim, said it was time Melbourne united and stood up to the violence plaguing the city.\n\n“I think the message that’s coming to us is we’re not safe on the way to work, on the way home from work, out cycling or going for a run,” she said.\n\n“It’s time as women, and men, we stand up and say no to this violence.”\n\nAnother woman touched by the death wiped away tears as she left a note addressed to the victim.\n\n“Dear unknown girl,” she wrote. “I’m sorry you had to lose your life in an unknown country at the hands of an evil mad man.\n\n“When WILL men stop killing women? Why was he not in an institution?\n\n“I hope you managed to have some fun in your young life and lots of love.\n\n“Although I didn’t know you, I will think of you everyday as I pass this spot.”\n\n","byline":"Jon Kaila, Christopher Gillett, Rebekah Cavanagh ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/couriermail.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/news.com.au/HeraldSun/HS State News and Galleries/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/Law &amp;

It’s an art form.\n\nBarista art is a huge industry in Melbourne, and extra flare and creativity is greatly appreciated by coffee connoisseurs.\n\nRita Zhang from the Home Barista Institute has been working with coffee for 12 years and says the popularity of coffee art has grown considerably.\n\n“Coffee art and any cafe business focus on coffee quality definitely helps their businesses to grow and attract clientele,” Ms Zhang said.\n\nA lady trapped in a capp...Cafe Zen Den - Main Road, Eltham @theheraldsun #MelbCoffeeArt pic.twitter.com/SUKhhFsOgL\n\n— Little Miss Lou Who (@LilMissLouWho) July 2, 2014 \n\n“This is especially true in Melbourne, where the standards are very high. The quality of coffee is firstly judged by the presentation (the Coffee art skills), then the taste (Barista technical skills).

We feel the art lies in the free pour designs, though can appreciate the talent exhibited in other forms,” Coffee Minded manager Jim Velmahos said.\n\n“It took me more than one year to master the art of consistent good coffee and presentation,” Ms Zhang said. The amount of time that effort that goes into learning the craft certainly pays off – and gives baristas a chance to learn new skills when they get a number of different requests.\n\n“When we get customers ask ‘can I have a latte with love heart today?’, it definitely makes our job interesting and satisfying,” Ms Zhang said.\n\n@theheraldsun we love a little coffee art 😀 #melbcoffeeart pic.twitter.com/fb5eLuCfcD\n\n— Macchinetta Coffee (@Macc_Coffee) July 2, 2014 \n\nManaging director at Coffee Art School Australia Steven Fan has been training baristas for seven years - and says the art of communication is key to becoming a real coffee connoisseur.\n“You can get the basics down in two days of proper training - but I recommend time to become a real pro is another 3 months,” Mr Fan said.\n\n“And there 3 months must be in coffee shop, so barista can communicate with customers, and find what they really want. This is the soul of barista.”\n\n“There are so many coffee shops in Melbourne, so most customers may feel valued or respected by giving them an artistic-coffee.”\n\n.@BrendoHeraldSun @AnneWardell still maintain this from @ONACoffee in Manuka, Canberra is the best coffee art pic.twitter.com/EaoPGdm5zt\n\n— Shobaz Kandola (@ShobazKandola) July 2, 2014 \n\nDo you have an example of great barista art you’d like to share?

What that sanction is I’m not going to speculate about that.\n\n“If he was exceeding his authority we have a problem with him. If he was doing what the AFL had signed off on, then we have a problem with the AFL.\n\n“So we are not quite sure where that sits.”\n\nEARLIER today, the AFL Players’ Association has condemned comments from the league’s chief medical officer suggesting “broad acceptance” by Essendon players of the club’s supplements program.\n\nThe AFL has sensationally revealed it sent specimens from Essendon players to Germany during 2012 — months before the club “self-reported” to the league and ASADA.\n\nA video emerged yesterday where AFL chief medical officer Dr Harcourt stated that the AFL had caught “wind” that the Bombers were using exotic drugs.\n\nIn the video Dr Harcourt says “most athletes of the team were involved — so there was quite broad acceptance by the players of this program even though it involved quite unusual practices and hundreds of injections.”\n\nROBBO: AFL’S ACTIONS HARD TO FATHOM \n\nESSENDON PLAYER IDENTITIES MAY BE REVEALED \n\nHowever the AFLPA hit back on Thursday morning, with acting CEO Ian Prendergast saying players didn’t expect to be subjected to such experimental substances. The players union says it will seek further information from the AFL regarding Dr Harcourt’s comments.\n\n“We disagree with Dr Harcourt’s suggestion that players passively accepted the use of supplements and did not ‘jack up and say what the hell is going on’,” Prendergast said.\n\n“As has been made abundantly clear on many occasions, players took an active role in ensuring that the substances they were to be administered were compliant with the WADA Code and were provided with written guarantees from the club to that effect. This is hardly what we would call ‘passive acceptance’.”\n\nHarcourt’s explosive claims were made in an address to an anti-doping conference in Zurich last November and seized on by lawyers for suspended Essendon coach James Hird in the Federal Court today.\n\nThe revelations raise fresh questions about what was known and suspected within the AFL about Essendon’s 2012 drugs regime.\n\n“We did have some wind of this during the course of the year — it was 2012,” Harcourt said in his address.\n\n“And so we did arrange through ASADA to have a number of specimens of these players sent to the Cologne laboratory rather than the Sydney laboratory — but nothing came out of it.\n\n“Most athletes of the team were involved — so there was quite broad acceptance by the players of this program even though it involved quite unusual practices and hundreds of injections.\n\n“It was shocking the extent to which experimental drugs were given to young athletes.\n\n“It highlighted the craziness or madness of certain individuals in the support staff who really didn’t come to grips with what they were doing.”\n\nHarcourt also made the stunning claim in the video that “35-odd” Essendon players were being monitored for “potential hormonal issues or cancers”.\n\nPrendergast was also critical of the AFL chief medical officer to speak publicly about any potential health issues.\n\n“We also believe Dr Harcourt’s comments with regards to potential health consequences are unhelpful and have the potential to create unnecessary stress and anxiety for players and their families,” the acting AFLPA boss said.\n\n“As has been reported, the Players’ Association has been working with the AFL and the club to implement a health protocol to monitor players’ health going forward.\n\n“However, to publicly speculate on any potential health issues in the absence of any evidence is premature and inappropriate.\n\n“We are seeking further information from the AFL in regards to Dr Harcourt’s comments.”\n\nSix months after the video, show-cause notices would be issued to 34 former and current Essendon players by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority.\n\nVIDEO REVEALS WHY AFL TEAMED UP WITH ASADA \n\n“One thing that we have to deal with, and this is the sobering element, my job now is to work out a program to monitor the players for the next five to 10 years because they were given such exotic substances — many of them growth factors — which means that we are looking at potential hormonal issues or cancers,” Harcourt said.\n\n“So now we have to go through a process of looking after this 35-odd players just to make sure that nothing really nasty happened to them from this crazy activity that individuals allowed to occur at the club.”\n\nHe told the conference Essendon’s governance in 2012 was “shocking” and that Bombers players did not “jack up” and protest against the drugs program.\n\n“There was shocking corporate governance over the team … club officials who were blind to their accountability and (there was) fan syndrome — so the leadership within the club were ex-players who were icons of the game,” he said.\n\n“And I think this intimidated a number of management staff. Basically we think there was a degree of fan syndrome in accepting the leadership knew what they were doing.\n\n“Athletes passively accepted the use — this shocked us. Players did not jack up and say ‘what the hell is going on?’.\n\n“There was probable use of performance enhancing drugs … there was clear risk of use.”\n\nHe explained why the AFL booted Essendon from last year’s finals before ASADA had finalised its case against the players.\n\n“We had to deal with the team in the context of the competition,” Harcourt said.\n\nHIRD MAKES EXPLOSIVE CLAIM AGAINST ASADA \n\n“We pushed for there to be some resolution about that in around about July/August because our finals are in September.\n\n“There was an urgency within the league ... which was an issue we had to confront with ASADA who were focused on building there anti-doping cases which take longer.\n\n“So in a sense we have separated those two issues, so that we can address the issues of the team, but keep the option open of dealing with the individuals with doping violations.\n\nHarcourt said human-growth hormone releasing substances; sections of the HGH molecule; a dementia therapy drug and veterinary products were used.\n\n“Most of the substances were just recently on to the WADA list or in the `and related substances’ sections of the list,” he said.\n\n“The individuals who were going about this were trying to exploit the nuances of the WADA list and probably also had some understanding that some of these substances were so new, that the laboratories didn’t have the capability of dealing with them.”\n\nHarcourt did not return calls and the AFL declined to comment.\n\n","byline":"Michael Warner and Grant Baker

And that is build a side that is massively competitive,” he said.\n\nGarlett, who led Carlton’s goalkicking with 43 majors last year, was last week axed for rookie Blaine Johnson.\n\nLISTEN TO THE LATEST EPISODE OF THE SUPERFOOTY PODCAST BELOW OR CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE IN ITUNES \n\n“We see that (selection) as a step in the right direction,” Malthouse said.\n\n“Garlett’s just not kicking enough goals. And if you kick enough goals and don’t defend you can probably get away with it, but if you don’t do either you don’t play.”\n\nGarlett’s manager Liam Pickering has backed the small forward to remain at Carlton next year.\n\nMalthouse said prized pick Patrick Cripps was a chance to return from a broken leg against St Kilda on Sunday and tipped hard-working left-footer Nick Holman and Irish rookie Ciaran Sheehan to enter the selection frame.\n\nMalthouse highlighted Ed Curnow’s basic skill blunder late against Collingwood which allowed Steele Sidebottom to slot the match-winner as symptomatic of where his side was falling down.\n\n“The thing that beat us on the weekend was the talent level,” Malthouse said.\n\n“It doesn’t say (anything) about the heart level, it doesn’t say (anything) about the running level, it doesn’t say (anything) about the competitiveness.\n\n“It’s got nothing to do with the ability of want or courage.”\n\nThe dual premiership coach bemoaned Matthew Kreuzer’s long-term injury had stalled his development and also eliminated selection pressure on Carlton’s big men.\n\nMalthouse said Sheehan, who won a place at the Blues after impressing in last year’s International Rules series against Australia, had improved on the back of a strong development program.\n\nHe said Mitch Robinson was remorseful after copping a two-match ban for striking but the incident would help the utility mature after “drastically improving” as a footballer under his tutelage.\n\nThe 4-10 Blues’ losing streak is second only to St Kilda’s run of nine games without a win.\n\nCarlton’s run of losses is the longest a Malthouse-coach side has suffered since Collingwood dropped the final eight matches of 2005 as it secured a priority selection used to draft current-Blue Dale Thomas (No. 2) and Scott Pendlebury (5).\n\n","byline":"Sam Landsberger ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

At the moment there is a fair bit of daylight between what they are thinking and we are thinking. There is still time, but at the end of the day my job is to make sure Tyson is in a good place.”\n\nIn 2012 Goldsack had to wait until October to sign a new two-year deal as Collingwood attempted to recontract Travis Cloke despite 24 goals that year.\n\nThis year the Pies have already recontracted stars including Dane Swan, Harry O’Brien, Steele Sidebottom and Ben Reid.\n\n","byline":"Jon Ralph

a serious crime.\n\nMajak Daw has been charged on three counts of rape relating to an alleged incident involving a 15-year-old victim in Altona North in 2007.\n\nThe 23-year-old forward has denied any wrongdoing, telling the Herald Sun the allegations were ‘100 per cent wrong”.\n\nThe club has vowed to stand by the Sudanese-born player.\n\nDaw yesterday kept out of the spotlight while family and friends rallied together at the Wyndham Vale home of his parents, William and Elizabeth Daw.\n\nWilliam Daw appeared calm, but did not want to speak about the accusations or how his son was feeling.\n\nVictim support groups said football authorities should stand Daw down or he should voluntarily step aside.\n\nCentre Against Sexual Assault forum spokeswoman Carolyn Worth said it was time the AFL considered any player charged with sexual offences as ‘bringing the game into disrepute”.\n\nMs Worth said no other industry would tolerate a professional remaining in an influential role with sex charges hanging over their head.\n\n‘Until your name is cleared you shouldn’t be in a position of influence and I think those boys (footballers) are in a position of influence,” she said.\n\nWomen’s Information and Referral Exchange network chief Samiro Douglas echoed the calls for tougher action. ‘It must have taken a lot of courage for this woman to put herself through the trauma and bring these charges against a high-profile player almost 10 years later,” Ms Douglas said.\n\nWhen questioned by the Herald Sun in May, Daw denied the allegations. ‘I’m so shocked to even hear about this,” Daw said.\n\nandrea.hamblin@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"Jon Kaila ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and galleries/AFL/AFL

The businesses employ more than 2200 people nationwide and have 19 stores in Victoria.\n\nIt is the latest blow for Ms Cameron, who was once named Australia’s fourth richest woman and in 2006 sold her half-stake in Kathmandu for $250 million.\n\nShe bought Retail Adventures three years later for $85 million, but it collapsed in 2012 with $170 million in debt.\n\nIt is thought Ms Cameron had been searching for a buyer or investor to prop up the discount business before it collapsed, and had planned to close about 50 stores.\n\nReceiver Rahul Goyal said the chains had struggled in a difficult consumer climate.\n\n“It appears that the financial pressures of DSG have been caused by the general decline in the retail sector, and particularly the decreased demand for discretionary items like those found in Crazy Clark’s and Sam’s Warehouse stores,” he said.\n\nIt was too early to fully determine the receivership strategy, Mr Goyal said, and the immediate priority was to exit unprofitable stores while consolidating inventory.\n\nMr Goyal said the receivers were searching for buyers for at least some stores while stock was sold off.\n\n“We will be immediately exploring the going concern sale of the profitable ... stores” he said.\n\nMs Cameron, who has campaigned on environmental and animal welfare issues, reportedly bought Retail Adventures with the aim of channelling proceeds towards her charitable causes.\n\nBut the group struggled, instead sucking up nearly all her proceeds from the sale of her Kathmandu stake.\n\njane.harper@news.com.au\n\n","byline":"Jane Harper ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/couriermail.com.au/Network News/","/display/heraldsun.com.au/HeraldSun/HS Business News/","/display/adelaidenow.com.au/HeraldSun/HS Business News/","/section/couriermail.com.au/news/","/section/heraldsun.com.au/business/","/section/adelaidenow.com.au/business/"],"commentsAllowed":false,"commentsShown":false,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"heraldsun.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T11:15:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T11:17:17.000Z","description":"FORMER retail magnate Jan Cameron is at the mercy of receivers as her business empire falls apart for the second time in less than two years.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/jan-camerons-discount-chains-crazy-clarks-and-sams-warehouse-in-administration/story-e6freon6-1226973520144?sv=a730a3e5f28f0df0838421a652c54029","name":"couriermail.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/jan-camerons-discount-chains-crazy-clarks-and-sams-warehouse-in-administration/story-fni0dcne-1226973520144?sv=a730a3e5f28f0df0838421a652c54029","name":"heraldsun.com.au"},{"link":"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/jan-camerons-discount-chains-crazy-clarks-and-sams-warehouse-in-administration/story-fnmxznqb-1226973520144?sv=a730a3e5f28f0df0838421a652c54029","name":"adelaidenow.com.au"}],"domains":["couriermail.com.au","heraldsun.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au"],"id":"4934329df694e1ac5b993359285eb9d6","keywords":["unprofitable stores","business empire falls","financial pressures","discretionary items","receivership strategy","concern sale","consolidating inventory","immediate priority","retail empire","retail chains","outdoor clothing retailer","animal welfare issues","private company","retail sector","retail magnate","discount chains","Victoria","Australia","Jane Harper","Rahul Goyal","Crazy Clarks","Jan Cameron","144 Crazy Clark"],"kicker":"Receivers in control","link":"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/jan-camerons-discount-chains-crazy-clarks-and-sams-warehouse-in-administration/story-fnmxznqb-1226973520144?sv=a730a3e5f28f0df0838421a652c54029","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973520144","originalAssetId":"1226973520144","originalSource":"HeraldSun","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/couriermail.com.au/Network News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"bd6556371119c1b1db9217e05b59db2c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974315380","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"c9bfb7b7c068e1f98324496628ac7b6b","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226973520116","referenceType":"PRIMARY"},{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"d0e6f452a046d9130678535b55abaa6c","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974315406","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"FORMER retail magnate Jan Cameron is at the mercy of receivers as her business empire falls apart for the second time in less than two years.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Jan Cameron’s discount chains Crazy Clarks and Sam’s Warehouse in administration","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Cameron’s retail empire crumbling","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"6960c804-00d8-11e4-a199-d36e19f21cac -

We’ll put that debate to the side for a later time, if necessary.”\n\nHaddad: “Okay. That’s good.”\n\nNolan: “We understand that’s what you say.”\n\nHaddad: “Yeah.”\n\nNolan: “And he understands what you say.”\n\nHird is studying in France and will return to Melbourne on July 28.\n\nHis 12-moth suspension expires on August 25.\n\n","byline":"Michael Warner ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/dailytelegraph.com.au/Sport news and

local councillor Daphne McDonald said there was nothing Gold Coast City Council could do because the beach was theirs to take.\n\nCr McDonald said official surveys showed that the boundary of the

said.\n\nNEWS: ‘NOT THE NICEST’ BUT NO CAT KILLER \n\nNEWS: KATELYN’S LAST HOURS \n\nWEATHER: SO COLD EVEN THE DOGS ARE RUGGING UP \n\nCr McDonald said residents might have also taken the step of putting up fencing because they were legally responsible for the beach portion of their block.\n\nLong-term resident Leonie Clarke, who owns a modest property on Jefferson Lane, said she would be willing to give the sand back if it meant getting a discount on her rates.\n\n“We pay about $10,000 a year here,” she said.\n\n“When I found out that we owned part of the beach as well, I went to council to see if it was right. We thought that we could not own past the watermark.\n\n“We were willing to give it back to council, but they said it was our responsibility and we had to pay for it.\n\n“If we could get a discount, we would still give it back. It is expensive and a hassle to look after.”\n\nMs Clarke said she did not bother fencing off the beach she owned, but understood why her neighbours went to the effort.\n\n“I am happy for people to sunbake on our bit of beach,” she said.\n\n“I don’t care ... just as long as they don’t bother us.

Footage showed not only had Harris partaken but he captained the team and did a large televised painting at the event — all of which occurred at Cambridge.\n\nThe dramatic discovery of the 1978 TV footage disrupted the trial as the jury, which did not know then of the footage discovery, had to be retired to allow legal parties to argue for their respective inclusion and exclusion.\n\nDefence lawyers knew its inclusion would go to the heart of their client’s credibility in the eyes of the jury since he was so sure on the stand of his evidence, with no-one at that point able to contradict.\n\nHis defence on that indictment — groping the 14-year-old on the buttocks in what she thought was about 1976 — revolved about his denial of the event and city. They tried unsuccessfully to have the footage blocked from inclusion on the grounds of fairness and prejudice and said their defence would have been different if the 1978 footage was known about.\n\nBoth prosecution and defence said it was not an ideal situation for either side but Justice Nigel Sweeney agreed while the case was at a sensitive stage he accepted the prosecution’s argument and allowed the footage to be shown.\n\nHarris attempted to counter and said that he did not remember being on the program but accepted he was there but did not realise it was Cambridge and added no celebrities probably realised it was that city since they all just got bussed around the country and that was the nature of show business.\n\nHe repeatedly denied lying or tailoring his evidence to suit the evidence presented but the damage was done.\n\n","byline":"By CHARLES MIRANDA in London

You’re by the beach anyway.\n\nHow many people do you save from parking fines a day?\n\nIt depends, some days motorists are really good (at paying for parking) but on days like Sunday, hardly anyone pays. I might do about 20, as a team we maybe save 60 in a day.\n\nHow much extra time do you buy them?\n\nEleven minutes - that’s 40 cents.\n\nLooks pretty easy - you just swan around all day feeding meters, posing for photos and selling merchandise for commission?\n\nToday (Sunday) was tough. People weren’t really interested - it was cold and we had jackets on...they want to see us in bikinis.\n\nNEWS: METER MAIDS’ APP ATTACK \n\nMORE GOLD COAST NEWS & GALLERIES \n\nHave to get to a certain level of training or spray tan before you can start?\n\nHaha...I went to an interview and started the next day. I got trained on the job, it’s not tough to get down - you just have to know the basic things people ask like ‘There’s no meters anymore so what’s the point of you guys?’ We now print tickets and put them on the windscreen.\n\nHow’d you end up on the Gold Coast?\n\nI’m just taking a gap year. I graduated high school last year and didn’t know what I wanted to study so came here to figure it out. I go home in November.\n\nSo there’s life after meter maid-ing?\n\nI’ve applied to go to college, I still don’t know what I’ll study.\n\nGet asked out a lot on the job?\n\nYeah in the bars later, every day. I just use the old ‘I’ve got a boyfriend’ trick. We’re allowed in some of the bars. Sometimes I work nights as well, that’s when the guys get drunk but they’re more likely to give more money and buy more things.\n\nGot a boyfriend?\n\nYeah I do, he came over with me, but guys never believe me though.\n\nHow’s he feel about you walking around Surfers all day in a skimpy gold bikini and high heels, selling calendars and key chains?\n\nHe’s all right with it.\n\nYour folks?\n\nThey think it’s cool, just because there’s nothing like this in the world. They actually came to visit for 11 days and they were a bit disappointed because I’d taken the whole time off work so they didn’t get to see me.\n\nReally? Dad’s okay with it?\n\n(Laughs) Well, I don’t think he really understood the concept of why I was walking around in this and selling these things.\n\nYou must get some nice reactions?\n\nSometimes people come running back to their car as we’re saving them and we get a big hug and they give us a donations and thanks. We have a stalker. He takes photos of us every time he sees us. He has our key chains that we sell and photos of us around his neck. He’s our biggest fan. He comes every Thursday and Sunday, he’ll just run up to us around 3pm and literally follow us around the whole time - sometimes we’re like ‘Cameron, back up, please’.\n\nNot threatening or creepy?\n\nOh no. I’ve asked him how long he’s been doing it and I think he said he’s the meter maids’ number one fan since 2003.

With bikini waitressing you’re basically just serving drinks in an environment with old men frothing - and you can’t leave. With this, if someone is bothering me, I can walk away. With waitressing you can have someone kicked out, but they have to do something really wrong - and it has to be much more than ‘Hey sexy, fetch us another drink’.\n\n","byline":"Ryan Keen ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Lifestyle/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Gold Coast News and Galleries/","/section/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T10:38:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T10:39:16.000Z","description":"ALL IN A DAY’S WORK...","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/surfers-paradise-meter-maid-on-their-stalker-and-why-it-beats-bikini-waitressing/story-fnj94iqm-1226974275108?sv=a0088bcf3449d92f28f9478c0e9978fe","name":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["goldcoastbulletin.com.au"],"id":"b663401c0377d6dcd1941779e78d64ee","keywords":["meter maid","Surfers Paradise meter","Paradise Meter Maid","METER FEEDER","bikini waitressing","key chains","Ryan Keen","Mike Batterham","Australia","FUN GIG","METER MAIDS","day feeding meters","skimpy gold bikini","Gold Coast","Queensland","Surfers Paradise"],"kicker":"Day in the life","link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/surfers-paradise-meter-maid-on-their-stalker-and-why-it-beats-bikini-waitressing/story-fnj94iqm-1226974275108?sv=a0088bcf3449d92f28f9478c0e9978fe","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974275108","originalAssetId":"1226974275108","originalSource":"GoldCoastBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Lifestyle/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"3a5c39a29ba46c5e177ecb5e738e0bdc","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974275056","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"A SURFERS Paradise meter maid has spilt the beans on their ‘stalker’ and why it beats bikini waitressing.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Surfers Paradise Meter Maid on their ‘stalker’ and why it beats bikini waitressing","thumbnailImage":{"authors":["Michael Batterham"],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Meter maid: ‘We have a stalker’","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"f743ae64-0107-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 -

Police interviewed him at the time and said there was nothing to suggest Katelyn’s disappearance was anything but a tragic accident.\n\nTalina said she and Katelyn had met Rob three months before Katelyn died, and she hoped he was at peace knowing that her remains had been found.\n\n“I am sure over the last two years it’s played on his mind, so I hope he’s a bit relieved knowing the news,” she said.\n\nTalina said it was hard to put into words how thankful she was to spearfisherman Drew Valentine for finding the bone and handing it to police.\n\n“There are so many people who have lost people and they are never found, so I am just so grateful,” she said. “When I heard it was her I just cried and cried and then I sat down and thought about it and called her family. You are always going to have questions that will never be answered, but the big thing we wanted was to get her home and that’s happened now.”\n\n","byline":"MACKENZIE RAVN ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Top News/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Gold Coast News and Galleries/","/section/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T14:01:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T11:16:49.000Z","description":"ONE person knows what happened in the minutes before Katelyn Hyland disappeared - but he’s contacted her family just once.","domainLinks":[{"link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/family-hope-to-hear-from-final-person-who-saw-katelyn-hyland-alive/story-fnj94j0t-1226974313654?sv=5746b0ae95c7b80b3ed3ac7ca924fd69","name":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au"}],"domains":["goldcoastbulletin.com.au"],"id":"d7beafc25dfc699d305de2ad54daac5c","keywords":["missing daughter","mysterious stranger","tragic accident","FAMILY PLEA","text message","jetty pylon","GOLD COAST NEWS","Teen death","Gold Coast","Queensland","Australia","Talina Anderson","Shireen Hyland","Katelyn Hyland"],"kicker":"Teen death","link":"http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/family-hope-to-hear-from-final-person-who-saw-katelyn-hyland-alive/story-fnj94j0t-1226974313654?sv=5746b0ae95c7b80b3ed3ac7ca924fd69","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974313654","originalSource":"GoldCoastBulletin","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","primaryCategory":"/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Top News/","referenceType":"PRIMARY","references":[{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":"8d9d8917e2e098a60538ddacfbb66648","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974315008","referenceType":"PRIMARY"}],"related":[],"standFirst":"THE family of a teenager presumed drowned on the Gold Coast two years ago are pleading for a man with her in those final moments to get in touch.","status":"ACTIVE","subtitle":"Family hope to hear from final person who saw Katelyn Hyland alive","thumbnailImage":{"authors":[],"categories":[],"contentType":"IMAGE","description":"Katelyn’s last hours lost","domainLinks":[],"domains":[],"format":"jpg","height":75,"imageName":"0f42994c-010f-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1 - Thumbnail (100x75)","imageType":"THUMBNAIL","keywords":["Missing girl","missing"],"link":"http://api.news.com.au/content/1.0/goldcoastbulletin/images/1226974315213?format=jpg","origin":"FATWIRE","originId":"1226974315213","originalSource":"Supplied","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","related":[],"sourceImageId":"1226974313853","subtitle":"0f42994c-010f-11e4-9992-0807e2bd5ec1","title":"Missing girl Katelyn Hyland","width":100},"title":"Katelyn’s last hours lost"},{"authorProfileIds":[],"authors":["Staff Writers"],"body":"Police arrested a 19-year-old at a house in Broadbeach this week and he’s been extradited to New South Wales.\n\nPolice and firefighters were called to Coffs Harbour Marina about 12:15am on May 3 last year after reports a fishing trawler was on fire, a statement by New South Wales police says this afternoon.\n\nNEWS: ‘THIS BEACH IS OURS’ \n\nNEWS: RUMBLES IN PARADISE \n\nWhile firefighters were attempting to extinguish the blaze, the engine of the vessel started and the trawler moved away from the mooring.\n\nFirefighters were forced to jump from the vessel, which then crossed the harbour and collided with a yacht.

District Court in Miami took just six hours after a two-week trial to find Jamaican-born Damion St Patrick Baston guilty of all 21 charges, including sex trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThe 37-year-old former nightclub dancer, music producer and self-described entrepreneur faces life in prison at his sentencing on September 5, with a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years.\n\nVIOLENT PIMP TO FACE TRIAL IN THE US \n\n“It did not turn out the way Mr Baston wanted,” Baston’s lawyer, David Rowe, told AAP.\n\n“He took it in a manly way.”\n\nUS prosecutors flew in two Australian women and one New Zealander to testify alongside three Americans who were turned into sex slaves by Baston.\n\nBaston beat, threatened and raped his victims, bragged about being a member of violent LA street gang the Bloods, and then kept for himself the hundreds of thousands of dollars the women made.\n\nBaston’s pimping began on Queensland’s Gold Coast, but led to the Middle East and the US.\n\nIn 2011 Baston, posing as a music producer looking for talent in Australia, met an Australian woman, known as KL, in a Gold Coast restaurant.\n\nThey began a romantic relationship and the woman believed they would open a restaurant together, but he began using violence and the threats of violence to coerce her into prostitution.\n\nBaston drove KL to prostitution dates, posted her photographs and contact information on local escorting websites and newspapers and collected all of her earnings.\n\nShe had to refer to him as “Daddy”.\n\nKL would return home with “thousands of dollars”, Baston would keep it and flaunt it, including posting Instagram photos of his $250,000 bank balance and $75,000 diamond-studded watch.\n\nIn 2011 Baston took KL to Dubai where she made large sums of cash as a prostitute and then they travelled to Miami, Florida, where he continued to pimp her.\n\nThe other Australian victim, TJM, met Baston at a party in Queensland in 2009 when she was 18 and they married in an Islamic ceremony in 2010.\n\nIn 2011 he was prostituting TJM and KL together out of several rental properties on the Gold Coast.\n\nMr Rowe told the jury KL was not the victim, but the “business genius” behind a Gold Coast escort agency known as Bachelors Club and Baston “was basically the security guard to make sure that the girls did not get assaulted”.\n\nBaston was arrested in New York in December after KL flew from the US to Australia to renew her visa and her relatives alerted the US State Department.\n\nIn 2010, a 21-year-old Lithuanian woman, known as GP, told NSW police Baston had hung her by her feet over a fire escape, forced her to remain in a scalding shower for several hours and beat her relentlessly.\n\n“According to the sexual battery detective who interviewed GP that night, GP was the most terrified victim she had ever encountered in her 25 years at the police department,” prosecutors said.\n\nBaston remains in custody.\n\n","byline":"AAP

And you know the person you are talking about wouldn’t want to be labelled with those terms either.\n\nThat he saw himself as just a regular bloke.\n\nBut Scott Sullivan wasn’t ordinary.\n\nHe was brave, he was selfless, he was inspiring. He was the one that covered my rent when as a broke backpacker, I moved into a share house in London. He was the one with the questionable affection for the Spice Girls. Yes, seriously.\n\nThe one with his yellow bomb called “Betsy” parked out the front of that southeast London home that ferried us to rugby games. A home filled with the optimism of being in your early 20s with barely a responsibility in the world with Europe and beyond at your doorstep. The kind of freedom you later realise is fleeting, a place where friendships are forged.\n\nScott or Sully, as everyone knows him, and I became mates in that house. I was just one of his many. Sully was also a son, a brother. He was to become a loving husband to Sarah, a father of two beautiful children, Abbey and Charlie.\n\nHe played rugby, an energetic half-back for Sunnybank, he loved to bark orders at the forwards. He had a special affection for the Rabbitohs, the Reds and Wallabies. He enjoyed a beer or, occasionally, some kind of fruity cocktail. Yes, seriously. He loved his Suncorp job. He loved his life.\n\nBut tragically, that life was cut short. Sully died two months ago. It was the end of a more than three-year battle with motor neurone disease, a cruel condition that kills the nerves that send signals to the muscles that allow us to move, eat, speak and breathe.\n\nThere is no known cure and life expectancy is three to five years after diagnosis. In late April, Sully fell and hit his head at his Brisbane home. He never recovered.\n\nIn the two months since his death there has been tears and laughter, as those that knew and loved Sully started to come to terms with him no longer being here. We’ve all thought a lot about Scott, about friendship and family and what is important in life. It’s been a confronting experience for many of us in our 30s and 40s who had never experienced the grief of losing a friend.\n\nNow I have had a chance to reflect on the life of Scott Sullivan, if there is one word that I believe does sum him up, it is “teacher”. And we will still be learning the lessons he taught us for years to come.\n\nDuring a speech at the inaugural MND Gala Ball in Brisbane in 2011, one of his many initiatives, he mentioned that he often told the risk team he managed at Suncorp that “setbacks were an opportunity to learn”, This was his approach to his diagnosis. Regardless of the outcome he was going to make every moment count.\n\nOnce Sully was told he had a terminal illness in 2010 he exposed his life to the world to give them greater understanding of what he and his family were going through.\n\nIn a similar situation I and probably many others would have retreated into their shell.\n\nNot Sully. He did this, not for his own sake, but for others.\n\nRealising that there was not enough support for those suffering MND, resources for their family members or funds for research, he established the MND and Me Foundation.\n\nNot knowing where to turn himself, he immediately set about putting in place a structure to help ease the stress for others when confronted with the same diagnosis as him.\n\nHe was being educated and we in turn by him.\n\nHis fundraising efforts were tireless. Gala balls, corporate swimming and golf days, media appearances, he even rode a specially modified bike with fellow sufferer Ian Davis, a Melbourne doctor, from Brisbane to Sydney to spread the MND message.\n\nI see the smile on his face as he and Ian cycled into Manly in Sydney, just over 12 months ago. The beers were well earned that night.\n\nTwo weeks pedalling took a toll on his health but, realising time was of the essence, Sully was desperate to ride to raise funds for and awareness about MND.\n\nFor the same reason he completed two Gold Coast Half Marathons after being diagnosed, the first in 2011 and then again in 2012 and, as his legs started to lose strength, he managed the 5.7km challenge last year.\n\nHundreds of thousands of dollars has been poured into research and on June 21 Sully’s vision, the Queensland MND Centre, a place for sufferers, carers, researchers and volunteers, officially opened.\n\nTo me, this resource, which will help thousands of people cope with the most traumatic event in their life, will be a way that they too will come to know Sully in the same way his friends and family knew him.\n\nDespite not being with us anymore, this centre is testament to his generosity and desire to help others. The kind of bloke that would pay the rent of a broke backpacker at a share house in London.\n\nThe last time I saw Scott was the day after the most recent MND Gala Ball in March. Everyone was aware of the toll that the disease was having. He had already had a fall which he was unable to break because his arms no longer functioned. His speech was becoming increasingly hard to understand. For all of us it was heartbreaking but if Sully and his amazing wife Sarah could cope then so could we.\n\nThat afternoon we sat chatting at his house as he drank some sickly alcoholic cider out of a straw. “It’s my new drink,” he told me. He was like that with his drinks. Last time I joined him for breakfast he ordered an iced chocolate with whipped cream. That day, our kids played together and we watched the footy. He was more than likely secretly enjoying the fact that my Eels lost in the last minute.\n\nI realised how lucky I was just to have an hour to sit there and chat and enjoy his company.\n\nWhen I was leaving I said I was looking forward to seeing him on the Gold Coast as one of the dozens of his friends and family that were going to hit the road and raise money for the foundation at the marathon weekend.\n\nSully’s fall happened a month later. We have mourned and continue to but while he won’t be at the starting line this week as he has been for the past three years, trust me, he will be right there running every step with us.\n\n","byline":"Heath Kelly ","bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"categories":["/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/Gold Coast Marathon/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Top News/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Gold Coast News and Galleries/","/display/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/Gold Coast Bulletin/Sport/","/section/goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/"],"commentsAllowed":true,"commentsShown":true,"commentsTotal":0,"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","creditedSource":"goldcoastbulletin.com.au","dateLive":"2014-07-01T22:17:00.000Z","dateUpdated":"2014-07-01T22:33:03.000Z","description":"Brave.
