  "body": "The committee recommended a wide-scale overhaul of the corporate regulator and recommended a royal commission into a scandal involving rogue planners in the CBA’s Commonwealth Financial Planning unit.\n\nFacing the media, ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft said the regulator had already made a number of improvements suggested by the committee, but that implementing some others would be very costly at a time when the federal government had slashed its funding.\n\nOne recommendation of the Senate inquiry was that ASIC undertake “intensive surveillance” of other financial advice businesses that had recently been a “source of concern” such as Macquarie Private Wealth.\n\nMr Medcraft said the regulator had already launched an investigation into Macquarie Private Wealth, including securing an agreement for the group to make restitution payments to some investors.\n\nHe said the regulator would be making a public statement about that action in coming weeks.\n\nMacquarie is being approached for comment.\n\nMr Medcraft would not say whether he supported the call for a royal commission into the Commonwealth Bank, saying it was a “matter for government”. He said the regulator would freely cooperate with any inquiry if one were created.\n\nWhile saying ASIC should lift its game, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann today played down the prospect of a royal commission into the bank.\n\nASIC: Inquiry calls for changes\n\nCBA: Coalition resists royal commission\n\nTony Abbott did not rule out supporting a royal commission, saying the government would closely examine the findings of the committee which had exposed “some terrible things”.\n\n“We want to get to the bottom of these things and we want to ensure that investors are as safe as they can be in a market economy,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Abbott noted the current “root and branch” review into the financial system was ongoing, suggesting the government would review the findings of that report and make any changes based on the combined findings of each.\n\nMr Medcraft said he had for some time supported some of the key recommendations of the Senate committee, such as increasing civil penalties for corporate wrongdoing, shifting ASIC to a user-pays model and requiring financial advisers to be registered and to sit a national competency exam.\n\nHe said a report published by ASIC in May found many civil penalties were far too low, with many of them set more than 20 years ago and not adjusted for inflation.\n\nUnder a user-pays approach those parties who were “high-risk” and required large amounts of ASIC policing — such as the financial planning industry, which was riddled with unscrupulous operators — would be required to pay higher fees and charges to ASIC than other industries which operated in a more responsible manner.\n\nThe Senate committee inquiry was sparked by poor financial advice provided to hundreds of CBA clients in the lead up to the global financial crisis, which saw them lose tens of millions of dollars.\n\nMr Medcraft said ASIC had placed too much trust in the Commonwealth Bank.\n\nLabor’s treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said the report highlighted the dangers of the federal government’s $120 million worth of cuts to ASIC over the next four years.\n\n“It is not an organisation that can afford these budget cuts,’’ he told reporters.\n\n“That tough cop on the beat can’t do their job with these sorts of budget cuts.’’\n\n",
