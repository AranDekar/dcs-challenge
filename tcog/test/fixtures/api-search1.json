      "body": "Emily Patterson has faced a real-life troll along with an outpouring of public support and generosity from those on social media.\n\nMs Patterson was at Aristocrat Cafe in the Lane Cove Plaza last Monday with her eight-month-old baby James, who was unsettled and crying ahead of his usual sleep time.\n\nAfter being tutted at by a woman sitting nearby, Ms Patterson said she felt obliged to apologise and take her baby outside cafe.\n\nIt was then she overheard the ladies saying she was neglectful.\n\nAnother mother present in the cafe and cafe owner Nick Drinias both went to offer Ms Patterson their support, saying she shouldn’t leave the cafe.\n\nMs Patterson then approached the woman as she left.\n\n“I told her I’m sorry they feel my baby’s disturbed them and she went to town, saying I shouldn’t have let him cry in the pram and was concerned about the patrons being turned away from the noise,” she said. \n\nUpset, she wrote about the incident on the North Shore Mums Facebook page while the other mother present posted to In The Cove Facebook page.\n\nIt attracted about 400 comments on the In the Cove page, plus offers of a complimentary beauty treatment.\n\nMr Drinias offered free babyccinos for the rest of the week and was offered rugby tickets for supporting Ms Patterson.\n\n“If I wasn’t perhaps as resilient, it could have gone so much worse for me such as if I was a first-time mum and there were a whole lot of other issues, ” she said.\n\n“My main issue is that the poor old sisterhood had taken a beating that day but after receiving so much support online, I felt the sisterhood made a comeback.\n\n“I know there’s a lot in the media about getting breastfeeding to be acceptable in society, but I think the issue is about people judging mothers.\n\n“It’s so tragic that people could be so harsh about others.”\n\nParent and child stress management specialist Patrice Thomas said mindful meditation can help other parents who find themselves in the same situation.\n\n“Learning how to do that gives you more equanimity in life and a bit more confidence not to take it so personally and put it in the perspective that it warrants,” she said.\n\n“It’s about being mindful of yourself and others.”\n\nShe praised the actions of the other woman present and cafe owner.\n\n“I think it shows more about the person making the comments to other people,” she said.\n\n“Good on them for going into bat for her.”\n\nSTRESS LESS\n\nStress management consultant Patrice Thomas will present a workshop for parents.\n\nWHEN July 23\n\nTIME: 7.15pm arrival for 7.30-9.30pm session\n\nWHERE: Pymble Turramurra Kindergarten\n\nADDRESS: 21 Handley Ave, Turramurra\n\nCOST: $25\n\nBOOKINGS: 9449 1445 or director@pymbleturrakindy.org.au\n\nDO YOU THINK CRYING BABIES SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN CAFES?

      "body": "The petition for a new skate park at Bob Campbell oval was able to flip the support of Lane Cove Council towards investigating a new skate park at a meeting on Monday night.\n\nThe council’s support along with signatures from a surprising number of older residents, has given the campaign an air of hope.\n\nGathering the signatures were keen skaters 11-year-old Charlie Nicholas, his younger brothers Oliver, 10 and Will, 8 and their friends.\n\nCharlie spoke at the council meeting on Monday night.\n\n“We’ve had a positive response from people of all ages,” he told the meeting\n\n“Some of the older residents have been talking to us, saying how it will be good and it will give us a chance to stop riding on the streets,” he said.\n\nCharlie also said it provided an opportunity for young people to socialise. \n\n“A skate park is where people can be sociable, spend the whole day and enjoy themselves and get fit instead of playing on the iPad and watching TV,” he told the meeting.\n\nAll councillors got on board, voting unanimously to create a working party on the issue, which will now investigate types of skate parks, possible locations and potential funding.\n\nLane Cove currently has one skate park within the grounds of Blackman Park in Lane Cove West, more specifically known as a flow park.\n\nHowever, Nicky Nicholas, whose sons started the petition said it was too small. \n\n“It’s one of those very small parks where you get half a dozen people skating and it’s already full,” she said.\n\nMrs Nicholas said she often had to drive her sons to the nearest skate parks in Five Dock or Cammeray.\n\n“For the 10 to 15 age group, the services seem to be lacking in the Greenwich area,” she said. \n\nA Lane Cove Council plan to redevelop Lane Cove Country Club’s clubhouse site including several tennis courts, was revealed in January last year.\n\nIn its place a new multipurpose centre was planned to be built, including an indoor skate park among other facilities.\n\n",

I’ve received donations from lots of big and small companies,” Amber said.\n\n“I’ve been told sometimes (homeless people) will go hungry to feed their dogs, so if they have that covered, they can spend their money on whatever else they need.”\n\nTo donate, or for details, go to petsinthepark.org.au.\n\n",

      "body": "Now it’s available in Chatswood.\n\nHurricane’s Express has opened at the Anderson St Dining Precinct in Westfield Chatswood, offering their famous ribs and burgers to the people of the north shore.\n\nOwner Craig Goldberg was a co-founder of the original Hurricane’s on Bondi Beach, which has built up a reputation for their secret sauce.\n\n“It has that flavour that you can’t find anywhere,” he said.\n\n“It was my father’s recipe and it was the perfect compliment to ribs and burgers. He still makes it for us. It’s the original recipe that we have been using for 20 years in Australia and many years in South Africa before that.”\n\nThe Hurricane’s philosophy is to source the best local ingredients, prepare them with care and keep combinations simple. Their signature dishes include pork, beef and lamb ribs, but if you feel like both red and white meat, you can get a chicken breast and rib duo.\n\nOther favourites for meat eaters include jumbo chicken wings, pulled pork, rump steak and a double decker burger.\n\n“We have char grillers which are specially made for us,” he said.\n\nTheir extensive menu has something for everyone with a veggie stack for vegetarians, and salads for a light meal. Goldberg described the restaurant as a casual dining experience, where customers can eat in or take away.\n\n“They have the cinema upstairs, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind you taking it up there,” he said.\n\nDETAILS:\n\nWHAT: Hurricane’s Express\n\nWHERE: Anderson Dining Precinct, Westfield Chatswood\n\nOPEN: Monday to Sunday, 11am to late\n\nDETAILS: hurricanesexpresschatswood.com.au\n\n",

We’re expecting roughly $15,000,” she said.\n\nGALLERY: Gordon East Public School’s sports carnival\n\n“Adam Kwasnik, formerly of the Central Coast Mariners, he warmed up the kids and had them do a small football workout session.\n\n“This is the first time we held this type of event. The kids love playing soccer, so we thought we’d incorporate it with the World Cup.”\n\nThe day was full of activities, with the drizzling rain not stopping the students from having a good time.\n\nMs Bogeff said Western Sydney Wanderers player Daniel Alessi even played on the muddy oval.\n\n“He said he would play some games with them, even though he wasn’t arranged for that,” she said.\n\n“I was worried about him that he would slip over.”\n\nMs Bogeff said the school tried to run a different event each year.\n\nShe said this was a popular event, but they always arranged days that would appeal to everyone.\n\n“We’re a really small school, but we’re very united. Everybody knows everybody,” she said.\n\n",

      "body": "“Over a period of time I lost my job, I lost my marriage and then really began a five-year episode of depression which my psychiatrist described as the worst he’d ever treated,” he said.\n\nThe Gordon resident, who was joint managing director of a technology company during the dotcom crash in 2000, said he almost gave in before realising he still had a lot to live for.\n\nHis words came during Men’s Health Week which ended on Sunday.\n\n“I had a suicidal attempt and gradually came out of it through a combination of exercise, seeing family and friends and working again by volunteering,” he said.\n\nWhile depression is an illness that can affect anyone at any time, statistics show Australian men account for 78 per cent of suicides, 84 per cent of preventable cancers and 61 per cent of deaths due to heart disease.\n\nIn the past year, 25 per cent of men haven’t seen a doctor compared with 10 per cent of women, which is why Mr Cowan hopes his confessions may help to break the conspiracy of silence that has long surrounded depression in Aussie men.\n\n“To a large extent men are socialised to be problem solvers and sort things out but when we can’t we struggle a bit,” he said.\n\n“I didn’t feel comfortable sharing what I thought was a weakness.\n\nAround 1 in 3 workers in the financial & insurance sectors experience a mental heath condition. PwC report @beyondblue #WorkplaceMH\n\n— PwC Australia (@PwC_AU) June 16, 2014 \n\nBut what Mr Cowan said he learnt from interviewing 4000 people for his book Back from the Brink  is that you shouldn’t ignore the signs.\n\n“I kept pushing myself when the market collapsed and the drive which helped my success also contributed to my demise,” he said.\n\n“The stress relationship is a bell curve and the big insight for me is learning where the top of the bell curve is and then when I reach it, knowing how to pull back from some of my commitments,” he said.\n\nDiagnosis of depression in men isn’t easy and Mr Cowan said you can often feel like you’re a burden.\n\n“When you have a cast on your foot people will go out of their way to open doors, do your shopping but people as a whole tend to stay away when you’ve got a mental issue,” he said.\n\nWhile it’s common for women to acknowledge their sadness and sagging self esteem, Mr Cowan who is also an ambassador for RU OK Day, said men shouldn’t be afraid to share theirs.\n\n“Reach out to people you trust, tell them what’s happening and that you’re not coping and ask for their support,” he said.\n\nBeyond Blue is a counselling service that can assist you if you’re feeling down 1300 224 636.\n\n",
